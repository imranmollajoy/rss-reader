Two years after Lego [revealed a buildable model of the Transformers’ Optimus Prime](/2022/5/12/23068250/lego-transformers-optimus-prime) that actually transformed, the [heroic Autobot leader](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=13923&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Foptimus-prime-10302) is finally getting backup with his second-in-command, [Bumblebee, debuting as a 950-piece set](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=13923&murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.LEGO.com%2FBumblebee) that transforms into a Volkswagen Beetle — or at least a close facsimile thereof.

In recent years, thanks to the run of big-budget *Transformers* movies, Bumblebee is best known for transforming into a bright yellow Chevrolet Camaro. But in the original ’80s toy line and animated series, Bumblebee’s alternate vehicle mode was the iconic Volkswagen Beetle.

*Lego Bumblebee’s vehicle mode appears to be a mashup of several different vehicles.*

As with its [Optimus Prime set](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=13923&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Foptimus-prime-10302), Lego is sticking to the original ’80s designs of the Transformers characters for Bumblebee. But while Lego does have a history of working with Volkswagen to create authentic-looking brick-built models of the automaker’s [Beetle](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=13923&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fvolkswagen-beetle-10252) and [camper vans](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=13923&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fvolkswagen-t2-camper-van-10279), the Lego Bumblebee’s vehicle mode looks like a loose interpretation of the beloved VW bug, with a dash of classic Citroën and Peugeot cars added for good measure.

[Hasbro’s original Bumblebee toy](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)/toys) wasn’t a perfect dupe of the VW Beetle, either, so this might make Lego’s interpretation feel even more authentic to nostalgic collectors who grew up playing with Transformers toys 40 years ago. But given the level of accuracy Lego includes with its smaller and cheaper Speed Champions sets, some, including myself, might be a little disappointed with Bumblebee when he transforms and rolls out.

*Minor disassembly is required to transform Bumblebee from robot to vehicle modes.*

Transforming modern Transformers toys can sometimes feel as complex as solving a Rubik’s Cube, but converting Bumblebee between his robot and vehicle modes appears to be a far less frustrating experience, although Lego hasn’t shared exactly how many steps the process involves.

*In robot mode, Bumblebee’s windshield transforms into an optional jetpack.*

There does appear to be one minor compromise in the transformation process. Bumblebee’s windshield needs to be completely removed before fully transforming from vehicle to robot modes, but Lego has attempted to appease Transformers fans by having the windshield itself transform into a jetpack, allowing Bumblebee to fly — some imagination required.

*Additional accessories include a buildable ion blaster and a display plaque revealing Bumblebee’s stats.*

Other accessories include a display plaque listing Bumblebee’s stats (fans may contest his strength and firepower being ranked at a meager two and one, respectively, but for courage, it’s a solid 10) and a buildable ion blaster.

*Bumper stickers are a cute but optional touch.*

Few [Lego fans like to see a giant sheet of stickers](/c/23991049/lego-ideas-polaroid-onestep-behind-the-scenes-price#:~:text=explain%20how%20Lego%20makes%20those%20kinds%20of%20choices) included with a set, but a pair of cute bumper stickers and a vanity license plate appear to at least make the painstaking application process worth it for Bumblebee.

*Multiple points of articulation, including individual fingers, help make Bumblebee posable in robot mode.*

*Although there’s no room inside for a passenger, in vehicle mode, Bumblebee’s doors can be opened.*
