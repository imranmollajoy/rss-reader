Last year, smart security company Arlo launched a [home security system](/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022) with several features that rivaled the excellent [Google Nest Secure (RIP)](/2024/4/8/24124244/google-nest-secure-security-system-shut-down-alternatives) — including multifunction sensors and an all-in-one hub / keypad. It then promised an [NFC security tag](/2023/9/20/23881842/arlo-security-nfc-tag-smart-home-system-video-doorbell) that would let you disarm the system with a tap. This week, it delivered on that promise with the launch of the [Arlo Security Tag](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlo.com%2Fen-us%2Faccessories%2FNT1201-10000S.html).

The new key fob lets you arm and disarm the system with a tap on the keypad hub inside your home, similar to what was possible with the Nest Secure. But Arlo has also added a handy option to disarm the system by tapping the tag on an Arlo video doorbell before you even enter your house.

The NFC-enabled tag is available now for $19.99 for a two-pack and works with the Arlo Secure app, where you can create access schedules for frequent visitors like dog walkers or housekeepers. They just need to tap the video doorbell with the tag during their designated access period and it will disarm the system.

Of course, the tag is also a useful way to shut off the system for those who live in the home, as it’s often easier to tap a tag on your keychain than pull out your phone to disarm it or punch in a code on the keypad. It doesn’t appear that the system can be disarmed using NFC on your phone, but we reached out to Arlo to confirm.

The [Arlo Home Security System](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlo.com%2Fen-us%2Fsecurity-system%2FSS1201-100NAS.html) starts at $199.99 and features a central hub / keypad with a motion sensor, speaker, and built-in microphone. It works with [Arlo’s All-in-One Sensors](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlo.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2FSS1201-100NAS.html%3Fgad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwsaqzBhDdARIsAK2gqnfrqZKk6FFAIt3yUhoXVYRLOPWs_YLHyWJO_-SGK1MVhwHiP9VA0_IaAvKrEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds) that are both contact and motion sensors, as the Nest Secure’s Detect sensors were. Each sensor can similarly be temporarily disarmed with the push of a button right on the device if you need to let the dog out at 2AM.

The multipurpose devices also act as light and temperature sensors, can be used as leak detectors, and can listen for smoke / carbon monoxide alarm audio sirens. The system can be self- or professionally monitored starting at $24.99 a month, which includes video recording for the doorbell and Arlo cameras.

The tag-to-disarm feature only works with the [newest Arlo video doorbell](/2023/9/19/23879706/arlo-essentials-second-generation-cameras-video-doorbell-price), which comes in two versions: one with HD video for $79.99 and one with 2K video resolution for $129.99. Both can be wired or battery-powered.

Arlo is mainly known for its smart security cameras, including the recently launched [Arlo Pro 5S 2K](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlo.com%2Fen-us%2Fcameras%2Fpro%2FVMC4060P-100NAS.html) ($249.99), which can connect with the security system through a feature called [Arlo SecureLink](https://kb.arlo.com/000062832/What-is-Arlo-SecureLink-and-how-does-it-work-with-my-Arlo-system) to keep it connected during internet and power outages.

While DIY smart home security systems have exploded in recent years, there haven’t been a lot of features developed that make them easier to use. The ability to tap your doorbell with your key fob seems simple but also really useful. I’ll be testing it out and will have a full review of the system soon.
