Threads will now let people like and see replies to their Threads posts that appear on other federated social media platforms, [the company announced on Tuesday](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/06/what-is-the-fediverse/).

Previously, if you made a post on Threads [that was syndicated to another platform](/2024/3/21/24107881/threads-fediverse-beta-launch-mastodon) like Mastodon, you wouldn’t be able to see responses to that post while still inside Threads. That meant you’d have to bounce back and forth between the platforms to stay up-to-date on replies.

Thanks to this upgrade, you’ll probably do less of that, but in a screenshot, Meta notes that you can’t reply to replies “yet,” so it sounds like that feature will arrive in the future.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg [also revealed](https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C8pQC2Ap_7w?xmt=AQGzoz7-N2pFMvlG4zT-eoGM1Mxr-ECH9LGSaoqVQRUPjQ) that Threads’ fediverse integration will be available starting today [in more than 100 countries](https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C8pQC2Ap_7w?xmt=AQGzoz7-N2pFMvlG4zT-eoGM1Mxr-ECH9LGSaoqVQRUPjQ), a significant expansion from its initial availability in the US, Canada, and Japan.

Meta has been vocal about its plans to integrate with the decentralized social networking protocol ActivityPub since launching Threads [nearly a year ago](/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor), with first testing [starting in December](/2023/12/13/24000120/threads-meta-activitypub-test-mastodon).
