*Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time* was Ubisoft’s breakout hit of 2003, but the company’s cult classic *Beyond Good & Evil*, released just two weeks later, will beat it to an upgraded rerelease. Ubisoft has released a trailer for *Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition* that confirms it’ll arrive next Tuesday, June 25th — just five days after I write these words.

I hope it stands up because I remember it as a phenomenal game. Jade and her pig buddy Pey’j were memorable characters with a remarkably lived-in sci-fi world, where you wield a camera and a mean stick rather than resorting to gunplay. It struck enough of a chord that gamers have been clamoring for a sequel ever since — but *Beyond Good & Evil 2* has now been [stuck in development hell](/2023/1/16/23557146/beyond-good-and-evil-2-not-canceled-development-hell) for 15 years, longer than even the infamous *Duke Nukem Forever.*

Here’s how Ubisoft’s trailer description describes the *20th Anniversary Edition* remaster:

> Embark on this epic adventure in up to 4K, 60fps with improved graphics, controls and audio. Explore the anniversary gallery, and discover more about Jade’s childhood in the new treasure hunt!

The trailer also mentions a “reorchestrated soundtrack.” Last year, we were also told it would have autosave and cross-save features, which could make it a good bit more pick up and play than the original, since 2003 was still the era of save points in video games. I’ll probably play it handheld!

We knew the remaster was coming — Ubisoft even accidentally released an unfinished version of the game last November and was [forced to confirm its existence early](/2023/11/29/23980960/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-2024)! And earlier today, [it deleted a tweet](https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-officially-unveiled-in-since-deleted-ubisoft-tweet) that accidentally revealed the June 25th release date, too. [The game’s trophies leaked](https://www.exophase.com/game/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-psn/trophies/) earlier this month. And Ubisoft also appears to have [delisted the original game from Steam](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/beyond-good-evil-delisted-ahead-of-20th-anniversary-editions-reveal-this-week/), though — as usual — existing owners like me can still download it just fine. Let me know if you see that change.

Meanwhile, the *Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake*, which should be a ground-up redo rather than a remaster and has [also seen its share of delays and even complete development reboots](/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal), is [now coming in 2026](/2024/6/10/24175567/the-sands-of-time-is-still-alive).
