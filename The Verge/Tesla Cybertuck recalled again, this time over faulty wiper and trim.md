Tesla is again issuing a physical recall of its Cybertruck. This time it’s recalling 11,688 of its electric pickups due to [a faulty windshield wiper](/2024/6/17/24180519/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-windshield-wiper-issue) that could reduce visibility for the driver, and 11,383 Cybertrucks due to trim in the truck bed that could come loose and create a road hazard for others.

Issues with the gigantic wiper had [surfaced in owner forums](/2024/6/17/24180519/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-windshield-wiper-issue) in recent weeks and reportedly delayed Cybertruck deliveries on short notice. [The NHTSA recall notice](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK/PU%25252FCC/AWD#recalls) for the wiper says that “excessive electrical current can cause the front windshield wiper motor controller to fail.” Tesla service will replace the wiper motor, free of charge. 

Regarding the trim, “Tesla service will apply adhesion promoter and pressure sensitive tape or replace missing applique as necessary, free of charge,” according to [a separate NHTSA notice](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK/PU%25252FCC/AWD#recalls).

Last week, dozens of the polarizing [Cybertrucks were defaced](/2024/6/24/24184698/tesla-cybertruck-vandal-deface-elon-musk) with the words “Fuck Elon” in black spray paint while parked in public parking lot in advance of today’s recalls. But at least [the man got paid](/2024/6/13/24177656/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-massive-pay-package-was-there-ever-any-doubt).
