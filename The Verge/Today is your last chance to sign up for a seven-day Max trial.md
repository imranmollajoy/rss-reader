There’s no denying that streaming services just [keep getting more expensive](/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max/archives/2), with [Peacock](/2024/4/29/24144507/peacock-premium-price-increase) and [Max](/2024/6/4/24171193/max-price-raise-ad-free-plans-hbo) being the latest streamers to raise prices across their ad-free plans. We’re also seeing a number of services — including Max — dropping support for free trials, ensuring no one other than paying subscribers can access their trove of content. Fortunately, if you haven’t previously subscribed to Max, you can [sign up for a rare weeklong trial](https://max.prf.hn/click/camref:1101lqHRA/pubref:verge/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F) through the end of today, June 23rd.

Admittedly, a week isn’t enough time to burn through Max’s extensive back catalog of original programming, which includes newer shows like *Hacks*, the animated sci-fi epic [*Scavenger’s Reign*](/23912922/scavengers-reign-review-max), *True Detective: Night Country*, and last year’s [excellent adaptation of *The Last of Us*.](/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review) It is enough time to revisit [*Dune: Part Two*](/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review) and your favorite Studio Ghibli film, though, as well as the first couple of episodes of the new season of *House of the Dragon*.

Max’s current seven-day trial extends to all three subscription tiers, all of which are set to auto-renew at the end of the trial period if you don’t cancel your subscription beforehand. The annual ad-supported plan starts at $9.99 a month or $99 a year, while the ad-free plans — both of which allow for offline downloads — start at $16.99 a month or $169.99 annually. Max doesn’t typically offer free trials, so if you’re unsure as to which plan is right for you, now is a good opportunity to find out.
