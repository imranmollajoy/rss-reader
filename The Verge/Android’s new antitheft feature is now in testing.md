Google is now testing [Android 15’s automatic theft detection features](/2024/5/15/24157068/android-15-ai-theft-detection-lock-privacy-security) announced at the I/O developer conference in May. The company tapped [Brazil to play host for the initial testing grounds](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-latin-america/google-for-brazil-2024/) on account of local feedback from users in the country, which is an apparent [hotbed for smartphone snatching](https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2024/02/19/brazil-launches-tool-against-smartphone-theft-eyes-greater-uptake/?sh=3e0ac73d21f7). You can [sign up to try the feature](https://www.android.com/intl/pt_br/safety/security/roubo-beta/) right now if you happen to live there.

Theft Detection Lock, as it’s called, uses AI to determine whether certain jerky movements are indicative of an ongoing theft attempt. In addition to relying on motion, it can also use other tells, such as someone attempting to use it on a different network or if it notices it’s off a frequently used network for an extended time.

Google announced the automatic antitheft feature as part of the larger privacy and security improvements it’s planning for [Android 15](/24160704/google-android-15-beta-new-features), which also include a [password-locked vault called “private space”](/2024/5/15/24157574/android-15-beta-2-release-private-space-rich-widgets) that stores sensitive apps and data. Theft detection will be backported to older versions, however.

In lighter news, Android users in Brazil aren’t just getting to test a new security feature. They will also soon find it easier to contact businesses — you can message them directly via WhatsApp by tapping a dedicated button that appears in the business’s search listing. They’ll also be able to set appointments with local businesses such as doctors and cosmetologists right from the search results. For now, both features are exclusive to those in the country.
