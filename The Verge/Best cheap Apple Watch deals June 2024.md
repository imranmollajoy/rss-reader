In September, Apple launched its latest batch of smartwatches, introducing the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri) ($799) alongside the [Apple Watch Series 9](/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri) ($399). Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the [second-gen Apple Watch SE](/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch) ($249), but the introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.

But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 10, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer; however, Apple [announced at WWDC 2024](/2024/6/10/24170653/apple-watch-watchos-11-features-updates-wwdc) that neither the Series 4 or Series 5 will receive watchOS 11 when it launches in the fall.

Picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get into the deals.

### The best Apple Watch Series 9 deals

The Apple Watch Series 9 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It introduces a slightly faster S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allow for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with your iPhone. It also offers a brighter, 2,000-nit display and works with Apple’s new “double tap,” a feature that lets you tap your thumb and index finger together to carry out various actions. While the improvements are welcome, the Series 9 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the [Series 8](/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables).

The Apple Watch Series 9 has been out for less than a year, but the GPS-equipped model is already on sale at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVB8BP1/?tag=theverge02-20) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Tracker-ECG-Apps-Always-On-Retina-Display-Water-Resistant%2F5402801238%2F) in the 41mm sizing starting at $299.99 ($100 off) or in the larger 45mm configuration at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSTFHP3W/?tag=theverge02-20), [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-45mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Loop-Fitness-Tracker-ECG-Apps-Always-On-Retina-Display-Water-Resistant%2F5401560310%2F), and [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmvJx1wnzhP) for as low as $329 ($100 off). As for the LTE model with cellular connectivity, it’s available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSV944N7/?tag=theverge02-20) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Tracker-Blood-Oxygen-ECG-Apps-Always-On-Retina-Display%2F5053065894) in the 41mm configuration starting at $399 ($100 off).

### The best Apple Watch SE deals

The Apple Watch SE [received a refresh in late 2022](/2022/9/7/23328608/apple-watch-se-new-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date). It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8 and Series 9. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).

At the moment, the best deals on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX9CY7W/?tag=theverge02-20) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor%2F5054105595%2F&subid1=verge050924), where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS in select styles starting at $189 ($60 off). The 44mm configuration, meanwhile, is available in select styles at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX74NJX/?tag=theverge02-20) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-M-L%2F5053502760) starting at $219 ($60 off), or at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmoAjljkp2K) for $229 ($50 off).

If you want the LTE configuration, the 40mm configuration is available at [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=verge051524&veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-Cellular-40mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-M-L%2F1436113900%2F) for $229 ($70 off) or at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHXDS8BW/?tag=theverge02-20) for as low as $239 ($60 off). The larger 44mm size is also available at [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-Cellular-44mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-M-L%2F1925514586%2F&subid1=verge050924) for $259 ($70 off) or at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Midnight-Detection/dp/B0CHX9MDXC/?tag=theverge02-20) starting at $269 ($60 off).

### The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals

Apple’s latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s new S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.

We recently saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to an all-time low of $642.04 (about $157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon with an [Alpine Loop strap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX9M3BM/?tag=theverge02-20), an [Ocean Band](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHWZ5VVM/?tag=theverge02-20), or a [Trail Loop strap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHX7C4CL/?tag=theverge02-20) starting at $719 ($80 off). While certainly not its lowest price to date — see above — it’s rare that we see discounts this steep across the entire line, which only makes select configurations of the Ocean Band and Trail Loop models more attractive.

### A note on the more premium models

While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.
