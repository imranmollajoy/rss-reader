When streamer Samantha Wong told Twitch that she had been sexually harassed by another person connected to the Twitch community, the report went all the way to the top. A Twitch VP who has since left the company, Justin Wong, says he escalated her allegations to Twitch’s CEO, the head of Twitch HR, and a VP who managed Twitch’s relationship with the accused person. “All assured me it would be handled,” he wrote [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JustinWong/status/1274919311782473729).

But a year later, the accused person was still being featured by Twitch. According to Samantha Wong, who streams under the name [Sampai](https://www.twitch.tv/Sampai), the person she’d reported for harassment was not only still allowed to attend Twitch events, but he was even given the opportunity to appear on segments on Twitch’s official channel. “You, as a company, minimized and dismissed my sexual harassment,” she wrote [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sampai/status/1274910389138935808).
