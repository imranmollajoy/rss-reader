> ASUS now has a new inbox called “<executivecare@asus.com>” that they have created specifically to re-process prior RMAs that customers feel were unfairly classified, were misclassified, or charged for a service that should be free
>
> ASUS has published a timeline for improvements: June 14th, today, is the publication of this email and template. ASUS has promised us an email this month with other changes.
>
> ASUS has committed to refunds of service charges for unnecessary repairs which customers felt compelled to accept in order to have a warranted repair covered, such as unrelated or misclassified CID \[Customer Induced Damage\]
>
> ASUS has committed to refunding shipping charges in scenarios where a warranted repair was part of the RMA. For clarity, if a customer has both an out-of-warranty repair and an in-warranty repair in the same claim, shipping will be covered by ASUS
>
> ASUS has committed to refunding labor and taxes related to these aforementioned qualifying disputes
>
> ASUS has created a Task Force team to retroactively go back through a long history of customer surveys that were negative to try and fix the issues
>
> ASUS has removed the power from the repair centers to claim CID. Now, CID claims must go through ASUS’ team. This will remove some of the financial incentive to fail devices. There still is one, but now it won’t be motivated as much by speed
>
> ASUS is creating a new support center in the US. This will enable customers to choose between a repair of their board or a faster swap with a refurbished board. This solves an issue where refurbs were the only option in some scenarios previously
>
> After over a year of refusing to acknowledge the microSD card reader failures on the ROG Ally, ASUS will be posting a formal statement next week about the defect, resulting from this series
>
> ASUS will publish a more transparent repair report template in September of 2024
>
> ASUS is changing the Advance RMA language to reduce emphasis on physical damage
