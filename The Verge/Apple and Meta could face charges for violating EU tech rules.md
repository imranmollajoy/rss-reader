Apple and Meta could soon face charges from the European Commission for violating Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules. The [*Financial Times* reported Friday](https://www.ft.com/content/31a996d5-b472-4357-953e-ace078494604) that the Commission is planning to charge Apple, and [*Reuters* reported later](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-meta-set-face-eu-charges-under-landmark-tech-rules-sources-say-2024-06-14/) that Meta could be charged as well.

The Commission is reported to be targeting Apple over its “steering” rules that charge developers for pointing to third-party purchase options. Meta’s charges will reportedly revolve around [its ad-free subscription for Facebook and Instagram](/2023/10/30/23938283/facebook-instagram-ad-free-subscription-eu) in the EU.

The Commission will be issuing preliminary findings, according to *Reuters*, meaning that the companies can make changes to try and correct things before the Commission makes a final decision. Apple is set to be charged first, *Reuters* reports, and the *FT* says we could see the charges in the coming weeks.

The European Commission and Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment. Meta declined to comment.

The charges follow the Commission opening DMA non-compliance investigations into Apple, Meta, and Alphabet [in March](/2024/3/25/24111232/european-commission-digital-markets-act-investigation). The DMA, [which designates](/2024/3/6/24091592/eu-dma-competition-compliance-deadline-big-tech-policy-changes) Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft as “gatekeepers” that must comply with rules over certain “core platform services” they offer, went into effect [earlier that month](/2024/3/6/24091695/digital-markets-act-eu-compliance-experts).
