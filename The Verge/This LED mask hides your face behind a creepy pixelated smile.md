The [Qudi Mask 2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qudi/qudi-mask-2-self-expression-redefined) could let privacy seekers who still want to be social have their cake and eat it, too. It’s a wearable digital avatar that hides a user’s real face behind an LED display and can automatically trigger a handful of emotive — but somehow also emotionally empty — expressions using head tracking and a mic.

LED face masks aren’t a new idea — you’ve probably seen teenagers running around with them on Halloween — but the [Qudi Mask 2](https://newatlas.com/wearables/qudi-mask-2-robot-face/) does more than just cycle through a preloaded collection of pixelated faces and colorful animations. Its faces can automatically change their expressions by reacting to what the wearer is doing. The sound of their voice will cause the animated mouth to move in real time so it appears like it’s talking, while the wearer nodding, shaking, or tilting their head will produce a yes, no, or confused expression, complete with a raised eyebrow.

A simple nod, shake, or head tilt is usually enough to convey those expressions on their own without an accompanying LED light show, but the Qudi Mask 2’s creators are seemingly trying to elevate their product past another Amazon impulse purchase.

The Qudi (which is apparently pronounced similar to “cootie,” [according to this promotional video](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNyBLyY5pQ4k)) Mask 2 is an [upgrade from a previous version](https://qudi.tech/pages/mask-1) that looked more like a paintball mask bedazzled with glowing LEDs. Version two appears to be more streamlined and purpose-built as a wearable digital avatar, and [according to its creators](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qudi/qudi-mask-2-self-expression-redefined), is capable of displaying more than 30 additional emotions and “millions of faces” using app-based customizations.

Three versions of the Qudi Mask 2 are planned: a cute Kawaii option; a cartoony Robot; and one called XX’s featuring abstract glyphs for eyes. A basic grid of color-changing LEDs could easily replicate all three of these designs, but the use of what appears to be segmented displays, similar to the digital clocks of yesteryear, will necessitate consumers having to make a choice.

As with most expensive gadgets, there will also be cases available for the Qudi Mask 2, but they’re less about protecting the mask and more about changing the appearance of the wearer. If you’re not opting for the alien option, which looks suspiciously like a popular Scottish cartoon ogre, you’re throwing your money away.

The creators of the Qudi Mask 2 have once again opted for a [Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qudi/qudi-mask-2-self-expression-redefined) to help bring version two of their mask to consumers. There’s always a risk when backing any crowdfunded product, even one that’s already fully funded, but early backers of the Qudi Mask 2 can get one discounted to $129. If you’d rather wait until after the Kickstarter is over, the full retail pricing will be closer to $199.

That is unquestionably expensive when you can get [something similar on Amazon for $36](https://www.amazon.com/Ompusos-Gesture-Transforming-Halloween-Masquerade/dp/B0BBVW17LP/ref=sr_1_5?tag=theverge02-20) that boasts over eight hours of battery life. The Qudi Mask 2 musters just three hours on a full charge. It feels like the digital equivalent of the classic mustache and glasses disguise, which doesn’t require you to carry an extra battery.
