[Amazon Prime Day](/2024/6/25/24145258/amazon-prime-day-dates-july-2024-sale) is fast approaching (on July 16th and 17th), but you don’t have to wait to get an impressive deal on one of Amazon’s flagship devices. That’s because [Woot](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/amazon-fire-tv-cube-3rd-gen-2022z-2) (which is owned by Amazon) is selling a **refurbished third-gen Fire TV Cube** for $79.99 with a 90-day warranty, saving you $60 off the cost of a new one until July 5th or until it’s sold out. This is the [latest version of the Cube](/23429259/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2022-review), which streams up to 4K resolution with HDR, supports Wi-Fi 6E for maintaining faster speeds, and also doubles as an Amazon Echo smart speaker for hands-free voice control options.

The Cube is Amazon’s most expensive streaming device, and even if you don’t fully utilize all of its features, you’re still getting some of the snappiest performance among most streamers — outside of the Apple TV 4K and its very high CPU headroom. The downside of Amazon streamers, however, is having to live in Amazon’s ecosystem, which includes various ads on the Fire TV OS homescreen. But if that isn’t a total deal-breaker for you, then this Fire TV Cube deal is definitely worth your attention.
