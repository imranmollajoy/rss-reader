With the ability to solve math equations and convert typed text into your own handwriting, Apple’s iPads are going to become a lot more student-friendly when [iPadOS 18 launches in the fall](/2024/6/10/24140821/apple-ipados-18-features-updates-apps-wwdc-2024). However, if you want something dedicated to studying or reading, I personally think an e-reader with note-taking capabilities like the [**Kindle Scribe**](/23484927/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-notetaking-pen-review) is a better choice. And right now, it’s on sale for an all-time low at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BS26B8B?tag=theverge02-20) and [Target](https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-scribe-10-2-34-16gb-e-reader-gray%2F-%2FA-88410166), where you can buy the Scribe with a Basic Pen for $239.99 ($100 off) or a [Premium Pen for $264.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BRZBK15?tag=theverge02-20) ($105 off).

In my experience, hybrid devices like the Kindle Scribe offer fewer distractions than your typical tablet, allowing you to focus better on the task at hand. As an e-reader, the Scribe also lasts about a month on a single charge, and its soothing light is easier on the eyes without sacrificing readability thanks to its sharp, 10.2-inch screen.

Aside from just being a good large-screen ebook reader, the Scribe has also come a long way as a note-taking device since it launched in 2022. It can [convert handwriting into typed text](/2023/5/22/23729817/amazon-kindle-scribe-kobo-elipsa-2e-e-reader-stylus-digital-notebook), for instance, and now allows you to write directly on pages of select titles. The built-in notebooks also [offer more organizational tools](/2023/4/24/23682206/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-kobo-elipsa-2e) and a better selection of pen styles. I still think the [Kobo Elipsa 2E](/2023/4/5/23669572/kobo-elipsa-2e-e-reader-tablet-kindle-scribe-onyx-remarkable) is the more intuitive and capable device — it can even solve math equations — but the Scribe is still worth a look if you’re already embedded in Amazon’s ecosystem.
