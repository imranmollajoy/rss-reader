Google has added new [Chrome Actions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/10957616?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) to mobile that will let you call, read reviews for, or get directions to a restaurant or other business — all right from the address bar. The company announced the new feature [in a blog](https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-mobile-features-june-2024/) on Wednesday.

Android users will see this new feature right away, but iOS users will have to wait until the fall.

[First introduced in 2020](/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements), Google Actions lets you quickly perform tasks from the address bar by typing in select queries, like “edit passwords,” “delete history,” or “translate this page.” It’s one of a few address bar shortcuts Google offers, like the [“@” shortcut](https://blog.google/products/chrome/search-your-tabs-bookmarks-and-history-in-the-chrome-address-bar/) that lets you quickly find bookmarks, tabs, and links from your history.

Along with new Chrome Actions, Google also added a few other Chrome updates, including live sports cards in Chrome’s Discover Feed. The feature lets iOS and Android receive automatic updates about their favorite sports teams and can be customized. In addition, iOS users will also now see trending search suggestions in their Chrome address bar when they click on it from the New Tab page.
