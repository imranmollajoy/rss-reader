An unofficial site tracking titles in the Epic Games library may have just leaked a ton of upcoming games, as reported earlier [by *Wccftech*](https://wccftech.com/major-epic-leak-hints-at-unannounced-games-coming-to-epic-games-store/). The site, called EpicDB, was taken offline shortly after it posted information scraped from the Epic Games Store catalog on Monday, but that didn’t stop people from scanning the list and posting their findings.

You can see the list of games from publishers like Bethesda, Sega, Sony, Square Enix, and others in a series of screenshots posted by a [user on a *ResetEra* forum](https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/). While some, like *Turok*, are easy to spot, others are listed under previously rumored codenames, such as [“Parkside*”* or *BioShock 4*](https://kotaku.com/sources-the-new-bioshock-has-been-in-the-works-for-yea-1840314561).

There are still other titles under codenames we haven’t heard about. [Some users speculate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/?share_id=6m1QV-LYimeoJ1TcX40o5&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) that “Momo” could point to a *Final Fantasy 9* remake, while “Selma” may be the PC port of *Red Dead Redemption 1*. The codename “Utah” could also hint at the PC version of *The Last of Us Part 2*, which is rumored to [be almost ready to launch](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-reportedly-ready-to-launch-on-pc).

Epic Games has since pushed an update preventing sites like EpicDB from scraping its list of unpublished games. “We released an update tonight so third-party tools can’t surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalog,” Epic Games said in a statement provided to *Wccftech. The Verge* reached out to Epic Games with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.

But with so many other titles listed under unknown codenames, like CurlyWurly from Sega and Brownie from Bethesda, internet sleuths still have plenty of mysteries to figure out.
