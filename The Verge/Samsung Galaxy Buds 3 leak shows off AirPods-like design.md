Samsung’s next Galaxy Buds have [been rumored](/2024/6/10/24175144/samsung-doesnt-fall-far-from-the-apple-stem) to resemble AirPods, and new leaked renders make the comparison clearer than ever. The renders, purportedly found [on Korean retailer Coupang](https://x.com/TEQHNIKACROSS/status/1803771740902035561), show that Samsung might be moving on from its bulb-shaped buds in favor of wireless headphones with AirPods-like stems, AirPods-like vents, and even an AirPods-like case.

I’ve made an image slider so you can compare one of the renders with a photo of Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro. The big difference with Samsung’s new buds is a metallic silver color and some more angular features.

If this is indeed the new look for Samsung’s earbuds — Samsung is [apparently working](/2024/6/12/24177301/more-signs-point-to-stem-sporting-galaxy-buds-3) on standard and Pro versions of the Galaxy Buds 3, both with stems — it would mark a big departure from the company’s previous design language, as the [Galaxy Buds 2 Pro](/23312192/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review) and [Galaxy Buds FE](/23954073/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-review) were much rounder and didn’t have stems.

We don’t know when these new headphones might be announced, but the company typically hosts summer Unpacked events, so perhaps they’ll be revealed there.
