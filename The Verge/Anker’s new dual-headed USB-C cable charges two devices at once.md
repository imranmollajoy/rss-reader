Anker’s trying something new that could potentially cut the number of cables you need to wrangle in half. Its [2-in-1 USB-C cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRZ6JJ6D?tag=theverge02-20) allows two devices to simultaneously charge from a single USB-C port with built-in “Smart Power Management” that automatically adjusts power distribution based on “each device’s power needs.”

The four-foot-long cable features a single USB-C port on one end that splits into a pair of USB-C ports on the other, each with a foot of cable that can be shortened as needed to keep things neat and tidy. It’s all wrapped in a durable sheath that Anker promises will survive “over 10,000 bends.”

Supporting the PD, PPS, and PIQ 2.0 USB power delivery protocols, Anker’s 2-in-1 charging cable can deliver up to 140W of power when connecting a single device to a power adapter. With two devices connected, such as a laptop and a smartphone, the maximum power delivery drops to 130W if one of the devices is drawing more than 100W. If neither device needs that much juice, the cable’s total power delivery is reduced and will not exceed 100W.

Anker has provided some additional details on how the 2-in-1’s automatic power management works. If two laptops are plugged in at the same time to a single USB-C power source, the first one plugged in will receive more power. When charging two devices from a slower 60W power adapter, such as a laptop and smartphone, the computer will only receive 30W of power, while the phone will be limited to just 13.5W. Not surprisingly, you’ll want to stick with a beefier USB-C power adapter to take full advantage of this 2-in-1 cable’s capabilities.

Data transfer is also supported, but unfortunately, Anker’s new 2-in-1 cable doesn’t function as a USB-C hub. Only the first device connected will be able to share data, and transfers are limited to 480Mbps USB 2.0 speeds.

Although we haven’t had the opportunity to test the new cable ourselves, it seems like it may require you to upgrade your USB-C power adapter to something with a little more kick. But at $25, the Anker 2-in-1 USB-C charging cable is a tempting upgrade if the inside of your everyday carry is looking like a rat’s nest of wires.
