LinkedIn is [rolling out](https://news.linkedin.com/2024/June/unlocking-new-possibilities-for-the-future-of-work-with-ai) new AI-powered features to help users find jobs, tailor their resumes, and even get advice from AI chatbots. But these new features come at a cost, as they’ll be available to Premium subscribers beginning in English worldwide.

One tool lets you search for jobs on LinkedIn by typing a prompt in natural language. In [a blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unlocking-new-possibilities-future-work-ai-tomer-cohen-4xtoe/), LinkedIn chief product officer Tomer Cohen gives the example of “find me a remote marketing job in Detroit that pays at least $110,000.” If the results are good, I could see this being a useful way to seek out potential jobs.

LinkedIn can also review your résumé and provide personalized suggestions for improving it for a specific job post. You’ll be able to upload a résumé, get feedback, and “make edits interactively with AI,” [LinkedIn’s Rohan Rajiv says in a blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/harnessing-ai-transform-job-search-rohan-rajiv-4og5e/). There’s a tool to help you build a cover letter “from scratch” with the help of AI, too.

These features add to other Premium-only AI-powered features LinkedIn started testing [late last year](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/celebrating-1-billion-members-our-new-ai-powered-linkedin-tomer-cohen-26vre/), which included the ability to summarize posts from your LinkedIn feed.

LinkedIn isn’t just using AI to help you find a job. It’s also beginning to pilot AI personas of a handful of experts that you can have conversations with to learn more about business-y topics. (They seem kind of like LinkedIn’s take on Meta’s [celebrity-based chatbots](/2023/9/27/23891128/meta-ai-assistant-characters-whatsapp-instagram-connect).) “The responses you’ll receive are trained by experts and represent a blend of insights that are personalized to each learner’s unique needs,” Cohen says. The list of instructors includes Alicia Reece, Anil Gupta, Dr. Gemma Leigh Roberts, and Lisa Gates.

The company is also promising that it will improve the platform’s search more broadly with generative AI, though it didn’t share much in the way of specifics. “With our new search capabilities, every search interaction becomes smarter — whether you’re looking to find someone, explore jobs, conduct outreach, or seek knowledge and answers,” Cohen says. “AI is set to revolutionize our search capabilities, enabling you to explore the depth and breadth of any topic directly through LinkedIn search.” Cohen promises that search enhancements will be rolled out “in the coming weeks.”
