While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and [Amazon Prime Day](/2024/6/25/24145258/amazon-prime-day-dates-july-2024-sale), many of the best iPad deals from the holiday season have persisted well into 2024. The discounts come and go like changing winds, but you can still take advantage of sales on many models today, particularly on the more affordable iPads. What’s more, Apple [recently released a new iPad Pro and iPad Air](/2024/5/7/24146276/apple-ipad-pro-oled-features-specs-let-loose-event), and they’re already causing prices on older models to drop even further.

It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at *The Verge *are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the [cheapo ninth-gen iPad](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation%2F674982024&subid1=vergedeals050224) of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips.

Announced alongside the iPhone 13, the [**2021 iPad**](/23639378/best-ipad-apple-buy-model-price#:~:text=Seifert%20/%20The%20Verge-,The%20best%20budget%20iPad%3A%20ninth%2Dgen%20iPad,-%E2%86%B4) is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having recently been [discontinued](/2024/5/7/24151124/apple-ipad-headphone-jack). The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.

If you’re still interested in buying the last-gen model, however, you can pick up the base Wi-Fi configuration at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmgwDJL2fQb) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation%2F674982024&subid1=vergedeals050224) starting at $249 ($80 off), which is just $20 shy of its lowest price to date. As for the 256GB model that normally retails for $479, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G96TFF7?tag=theverge02-20) is selling it for $379 ($100 off), which matches its second-best price to date. You can also pick it up at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmpRfhyH737) for the same price if you’re a member of My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total; nonmembers, meanwhile, can grab it for $399.99 ($80 off).

A last-gen model is still worth considering

The last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with [Center Stage](/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams), a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard.

Although the newer [**10th-gen iPad**](/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados) came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people. The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack.

In the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale in select colors at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/?tag=theverge02-20) starting at $321 ($28 off); [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLBNNRT?tag=theverge02-20) is also selling the step-up 256GB model starting at $474, which is $25 off its new starting price of $499.

The [**sixth-gen iPad Mini**](/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review) has a larger screen than its predecessor, along with an A15 Bionic processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has forfeited its 3.5mm headphone jack and dedicated home button in the process, but overall, it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.

The changes and refinements to the newest iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.

As of right now, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9BXKF5?tag=theverge02-20) is selling the latest iPad Mini in its 64GB base configuration in select colors starting at $449 ($50 off). If you need additional storage, the 256GB model is also on sale at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G99Y4NL?tag=theverge02-20) for $617 ($32 off). As for the unlocked cellular model, it’s currently available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9GM743?tag=theverge02-20) with 64GB of storage starting at $624 ($25 off).

The last-gen iPad Air was once our top iPad recommendation for most people thanks to its speedy M1 processor, slick modern design, and midrange price. The 2022 iteration of Apple’s lightweight tablet is similar in terms of its capabilities when measured against the fourth-gen model but still offers a handful of iterative upgrades. The most pronounced improvement is the inclusion of the M1 processor, which offers better performance and support for Apple’s forthcoming [Apple Intelligence features](/2024/6/10/24175405/wwdc-apple-ai-news-features-ios-18-macos-15-iphone-ipad-mac). The front-facing 12MP camera, which supports Apple’s Center Stage feature, is another notable upgrade, one that helps keep you better centered in the frame during video calls.

The fifth-gen [**iPad Air**](/22979828/apple-ipad-air-2022-review) used to retail for $599, but right now, the 64GB / Wi-Fi configuration is on sale in select colors at [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-5th-Generation%2F849759309) starting at $399 ($200 off), likely as a result of the [2024 model’s recent arrival](/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024). For those who crave more storage, the 256GB variant is available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3JDWSL?tag=theverge02-20) in select colors for $599.99 ($150 off) when you clip the on-page coupon.

Apple just recently launched the [**2024 iPad Air**](/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024), which features several small upgrades. The newer model doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the [Apple Pencil Pro](/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features) and both [previous-gen Magic Keyboards](/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features), too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799.

Deals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch Wi-Fi model in select colors at Amazon with [128GB of storage starting at $569.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J7W33Y?tag=theverge02-20) ($29 off) or [256GB of storage starting at $658.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J5D33G?tag=theverge02-20) ($40 off). The 13-inch iPad Air, meanwhile, is available in select colors at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6RTCT?tag=theverge02-20) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2024-Apple-13-inch-iPad-Air-M2-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F5590678210) in its base 128GB configuration starting at $754 ($45 off) or with [256GB of storage at Amazon starting at $848.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J7Z8CY?tag=theverge02-20) ($50 off).

Compared to the latest iPad Air, the [**2024 iPad Pro**](/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review) is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest [M4 chip](/2024/5/7/24148451/apple-m4-chip-ai-ipad-macbook), which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.

As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is on sale at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9XDMQ?tag=theverge02-20) starting at $944 ($55 off). The 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9SMLK/?tag=theverge02-20) in its 256GB base configuration starting at $1,199 (about $100 off). If you prefer a different retailer, you can also pick up the 11- and 13-inch models at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmgvZ8KY6XY). Members of the retailer’s premium rewards program — My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total — can save $50 to $100 on select models, though the exact amount will depend on the size and configuration you’re after.
