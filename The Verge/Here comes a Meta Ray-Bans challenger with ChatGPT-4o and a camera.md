If you want a pair of glasses with hands-free video recording and an AI voice assistant, there aren’t a lot of options, and the [Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review) are the [clear leader](/2024/5/3/24148513/meta-rayban-smart-glasses-ai-wearable-race). But Solos, whose smart glasses currently only feature audio, says it’ll sell a camera-equipped version later this year — with [OpenAI’s new GPT-4o AI model](/2024/5/13/24155493/openai-gpt-4o-launching-free-for-all-chatgpt-users) to let the camera recognize objects and answer questions about what you’re seeing.

The Solos AirGo Vision also include the same swappable frame system as Solos’ other glasses so you can swap out the camera — if you’re going somewhere a camera wouldn’t be socially acceptable, or if you’d just rather have [a different look or some sun shades instead](https://solosglasses.com/collections/accessories). Additional frames cost between $89 and $129.

The Vision will also have notification LEDs to warn you of incoming calls or emails, the company says, and the company claims they can also be integrated with Google Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude AI models. Like Meta’s Ray-Bans, they’ll answer questions over audio — they don’t have a display other than the LEDs.

The AirGo Vision don’t have a price or specific release date yet, but you can expect them to cost more than $249.99 — because that’s how much Solos will charge for a pair *without* the camera this July. The Ray-Bans currently still start at $299.
