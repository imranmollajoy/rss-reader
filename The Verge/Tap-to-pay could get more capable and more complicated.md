At some point in the future, [a new “Multi-Purpose Tap” concept](https://nfc-forum.org/news/2024-07-nfc-forum-defines-next-generation-of-contactless-user-experience-with-multi-purpose-tap/) will let payment cards or devices like smartwatches and phones accomplish multiple things at once when using NFC. With this in play, a customer in a store might tap their phone with Apple Wallet or Google Pay on a terminal that simultaneously checks their ID if they’re buying booze, add points to their loyalty account, pay for their goods, and provide them with a digital receipt.

Some of the concept’s goals are laid out today in a [PDF from the NFC Forum](https://nfc-forum.org/uploads/nfc-forum-multipurpose-tap-v1.pdf), the nonprofit consortium of tech companies that guides and promotes the NFC standard and which includes Apple, Google, and Sony [among its roster](https://nfc-forum.org/about/member-companies).

No more paper, just receipts on my phone? Sign me up. The forum says that this could also be used to share details about a product, like the best way to recycle it, when you use an NFC tap to pay.

However, the Multi-Purpose Tap vision the forum presents raises some privacy questions. The forum highlights how it also means you, the customer, no longer have to enter your details into a separate tablet next to a register to get your points. But it “could also be used to trigger specific, targeted marketing communications.” That’s less appealing.

The details of how retailers and payment-processing companies would use this in the real world are unknown, but making it too easy for a retailer to link activity to an individual profile [can cause all kinds of problems](/2012/2/17/2804554/target-data-mining-advertising-pregnancy-prediction).
