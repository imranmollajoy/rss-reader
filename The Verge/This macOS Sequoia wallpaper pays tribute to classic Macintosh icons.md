Apple is introducing a new dynamic screensaver and wallpaper combo in macOS Sequoia that respectfully eulogizes retro Macintosh iconography. Simply dubbed “Macintosh,” [*MacRumors* reports](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/macos-sequoia-wallpaper/) that the animated wallpaper shifts through graphics designed by [Susan Kare](https://kareprints.com/pages/about), the artist and early Apple employee responsible for many of the typefaces and interface elements on the first Macintosh personal computer.

Users can’t control which icons will appear in the randomized Macintosh wallpaper. Some recognizable highlights include the iconic “Happy Mac” boot-up icon, the Dogcow (also known as Clarus) used within the Print Setup dialog box, the floral-inspired Command icon, and the Bomb that appeared when classic macOS crashed. The wallpaper is available in eight colors alongside Spectrum, Random, and Accent.

[macOS Sequoia‌](/2024/6/10/24170586/macos-15-mac-apple-ai-wwdc-2024) is required to get the full animated effect, but that’s only currently available to developers ahead of the full version being released later this fall. For now, Apple design enthusiast [Basic Apple Guy](https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/macintoshwallpapers) has shared a bunch of high-resolution screenshots of the Macintosh wallpaper that showcase some of its best bits and work beautifully as still wallpapers on other devices.
