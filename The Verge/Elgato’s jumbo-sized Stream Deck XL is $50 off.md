The **Elgato Stream Deck XL** is once again selling for $199.99 ($50 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RL8H55Z?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmxmiCH66fW), and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1485171-REG%2Fcorsair_10gat9901_stream_deck_xl.html%2F). The jumbo-sized macro pad has 32 customizable LCD keys for controlling various functions on a Windows PC or Mac. It’s a staple among enthusiast and high-level Twitch streamers, but its customizability makes it [incredibly handy for all sorts of desktop and laptop users](/23700541/stream-deck-hacks-uses).

Want a button for quickly muting yourself on a Zoom call or to promptly summon Spotify? No problem. How about a series of buttons for controlling audio functions or emotes in your favorite game? With 32 keys, you have enough for a whole bunch of helpful tools at your disposal, or you can fill some with silly and superfluous things like [popping fake bubble wrap](/23706779/stream-deck-pop-bubbles-bubbledeck). (We’re certainly not going to judge!)

While the newer $100 [Stream Deck Neo](/2024/4/18/24132766/elgato-neo-family-devices-stream-deck) with eight keys and capacitive page-scrolling buttons may be a more logical choice for most, there’s something about the Stream Deck XL’s massive four-by-eight lineup of keys that seems impressively cool on a desk.
