If you’re looking for a budget-friendly video doorbell, the battery-powered Blink Video Doorbell is [one of our favorite models](/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera). The 1080p doorbell delivers all the basics, including support for motion detection, two-way video, and night vision. What’s most notable about this deal, though, is that the bundle includes Blink’s Sync Module 2, which is an [optional $49.99 add-on](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ/?tag=theverge02-20) that allows for free local storage and on-demand live views. Those are features you’d otherwise have to pay a subscription fee for, which makes some of the tradeoffs — including the doorbell’s lack of smart alerts and the fact it only works with Amazon Alexa — a little easier to overlook, especially at this price.
