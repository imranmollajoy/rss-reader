*Strands*, *The New York Times’* very good word search game, has been officially added to the NYT’s Games app on iOS and Android.

For me personally, this is huge. *Strands* has become my favorite of the *NYT*’s games since it launched in beta in March, but I was annoyed that I had to bounce between the app and a browser to complete my daily *Wordle*, *Connections*, and *Strands*. Now, I can do all of the puzzles right in the app over my morning coffee. It’s the little things!

Each *Strands* puzzle has a theme. That theme hints at the words you’ll need to find — including the “spangram” word that *spans* across opposite sides of the puzzle. Every letter in the puzzle is used for a themed word or the spangram. If you need some help, you can get hints by finding three non-themed words on the board.

*Strands* is currently the *NYT*’s “third most searched game, behind *Wordle* and *Connections,*” and is “nearly as popular” as *Spelling Bee, The New York Times* says [in a blog post](https://www.nytco.com/press/solvers-can-now-play-strands-in-the-new-york-times-games-app/). Most people are actually finishing their *Strands* puzzles, too: “We consistently see 83% of *Strands* players finding the Spangram each day, and completion rate is around 81%, similar to the *Mini Crossword* and *Tiles*.” *Strands* will be added to the Game tab in the main *NYT* app “later this year.”

*The New York Times*’ games aren’t always hits on the level of [*Wordle*](/2024/5/7/24151203/wordle-puzzle-archive-new-york-times), [*Connections*](/2023/8/28/23848942/new-york-times-game-connections-iphone-android), or *Strands*. *Digits*, a math-based puzzle game, was only available in beta [for a few months](/2023/7/18/23798932/the-new-york-times-digits-math-based-puzzle-game-shut-down). At least it had a [clever title](/24186786/wordle-original-name-mr-bugs-wordy-nugz-wardle).

***Correction, June 27th**: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the word that spans a* Strands *puzzle. The word is spangram, not spanagram. *
