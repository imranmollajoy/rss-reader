The Android ecosystem is all about choice. While iPhone owners have [a smaller pool of new devices to pick from](/23618862/best-iphone-camera-battery-screen-guide) when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a much wider range of choices on Android. You want incredible camera zoom? A built-in stylus? A phone that runs a complete desktop environment when you plug it into a monitor? You can find it on Android. Heck, you can find all of that in [a single device](/24053907/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review-ai-screen-camera-battery).

On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. ([I have my own](/2023/5/20/23730130/apple-iphone-13-mini-apple-phones), personally.)

If [Samsung’s S24-series launch event](/2024/1/17/24041928/samsung-galaxy-s24-ai-event-2024) is anything to go by, then it’s a safe bet that this year’s mobile tech buzzword will be AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. Google’s Pixel phones have some neat AI photo editing tricks, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But just keep in mind that you’re always just a few taps away from AI-gone-wrong atrocities like [Pillow Arm](/24058916/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review-screen-battery-camera#:~:text=a%20new%20arm%20made%20out%20of%20pillows). Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.

### What I’m looking for

#### Longevity

A great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. A minimum of three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates.

#### A great screen

The best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life.

#### Quality cameras

Any phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well.

#### Wireless charging

Most phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for a lot of people since it’s convenient for charging many different kinds of devices.

If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations. 

With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal. 

However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone.

### The best Android phone overall

<span class="small">***Screen:** 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED / **Processor:** Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / **Cameras:** 50-megapixel F1.8 main with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie / **Battery:** 4,900mAh / **Charging:** 45W wired, 15W wireless / **Weather resistance:** IP68*</span>

Samsung’s bigger flagship — but not [the *big* big flagship](/24053907/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review-ai-screen-camera-battery) — is once again the best Android phone for most people. The Galaxy S24 Plus is a crowd-pleaser if the crowds want a big screen, impressive cameras, and good battery life (I think they do).

Samsung makes a big deal about its AI features, which are like all AI features on phones right now: hit-and-miss. You can have the phone act as a real-time language translator on phone calls. It works well enough and could really come in handy in a pinch. But the generative AI photo edits? Still very much [a work in progress](/24058916/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review-screen-battery-camera#:~:text=a%20new%20arm%20made%20out%20of%20pillows).

Outside of software updates, you won’t find much new hardware here — and that’s fine. The updated Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset is powerful enough for just about anyone, the battery is a little bigger, and the screen gets a resolution bump this year for a crisper image. If these sound like minor updates, it’s because they are. But that’s okay when you’re already giving the people what they want.

### The best maximalist phone

<span class="small">***Screen: **6.8-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED / **Processor: **Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / **Cameras:** 200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie / **Battery: **5,000mAh / **Charging:** 45W wired, 15W wireless / **Weather resistance:** IP68*</span>

The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra says it all in the name: *Ultra.* It has everything you could ask for in a phone — well, at least one that doesn’t fold in half. There’s a stylus, two telephoto cameras, a massive battery, and one of the best ding dang screens on any phone, anywhere.

*Write your grocery list in style.*

So why am I a little underwhelmed? For starters, Samsung swapped last year’s 10x telephoto camera for a higher-resolution 5x camera that uses in-sensor crop to zoom to 10x. This is a sensible move, and photos at 10x look *fine*, if not as crisp as they did on the last model. It’s also pricier this time around, and it was already an expensive phone. It’s pretty darn heavy, too, and Samsung’s switch to titanium for the frame hasn’t made it any lighter.

Personal feelings about the zoom lens aside, the S24 Ultra is still basically peerless. Its much-touted AI features are fine, but if there’s one thing that makes it worth the upgrade, it’s the screen. Its anti-glare coating and boosted maximum brightness make it so comfortable to use outside it’s almost magic. That’s hardly a fancy new tech feature, but the Galaxy S24 Ultra is hardly any old phone.

### The best phone if you’re sick of hearing about AI

<span class="small">***Screen:** 6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / **Processor:** Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 **Cameras:** 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 64-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 48-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide / **Battery:** 5400mAh / **Charging:** 80W wired, 50W wireless / **Weather-resistance rating:** IP65*</span>

After a few years and [a little soul-searching](https://youtu.be/xd-SefaGrLM?si=LzF8afFoHpSq2ZX9), OnePlus is back to its roots. The OnePlus 12 is an excellent device with high-end performance with a competitive price: $799 for the base model with a hefty 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

For that price, you get a crisp 1440p 6.8-inch display, a top-tier Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, and a capable camera. It supports wireless charging, something that previous OnePlus flagships have skipped. Battery performance is fantastic, too — power users can get through a full day, and light users can stretch it to two.

*The OnePlus 12 gets the basics right at a very nice price.*

What stands out about the OnePlus 12, though, might just be what’s *not* here: a bunch of AI features. Honestly? That’s kind of refreshing. Some of the AI features Google and Samsung are busy shipping right now are nice, but none of them feel essential. If you want to sit out this AI hype cycle but you still want a great phone, the OnePlus 12 might be the one.

### The best phone for family photography

<span class="small">***Screen:** 6.7-inch 1344p 120Hz LTPO OLED / **Processor:** Tensor G3 **Cameras:** 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 48-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 48-megapixel ultrawide / **Battery:** 5050mAh / **Charging:** 30W wired, 23W wireless with Pixel Stand 2 / **Weather-resistance rating:** IP68*</span>

Anyone who’s ever tried to photograph a young child understands what a phone camera is up against: an unpredictable (but adorable!) subject that won’t. Ever. Sit. Still. The Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro [tackle this age-old problem](/23914615/pixel-8-pro-camera-parents-best-take-face-unblur) with some new tech: AI. And unlike most recent AI features on smartphones, these tools really do come in handy.

Both phones include an AI editing tool that will let you choose the best expression for each person in your photo when you take a burst of images — especially handy if you want to get one with everyone looking at the camera. There’s AI to improve the audio in your videos, too, allowing you to minimize distracting background noises.

*The Pixel 8 Pro comes with a few features perfect for photographing little monsters.*

The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro have highly capable cameras in general, though only the pricier 8 Pro has a telephoto lens. It’s worth the upgrade if you’re a keen photographer. The 8 Pro also comes with a bigger screen and battery, which a lot of people will appreciate. The light and svelte Pixel 8, with its 6.2-inch screen, is a good choice for small-ish phone fans. Both phones use Google’s Tensor G3 chipset, though [only the 8 Pro](/2024/3/7/24093603/the-pixel-8-wont-get-gemini-nano-because-of-reasons) is able to run large language models on-device — that’ll be important in the future as AI tools (possibly?) become more useful.

Otherwise, the 8 and 8 Pro are good all-around devices — just know that Pixels are unfortunately susceptible to an [unusual bug here and there](/2024/1/24/24048920/google-pixel-bug-internal-storage-access-crashing-apps). None of the review units I’ve tested have suffered from them, but [they’re out there](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-experience-unreliable-inconsistent-editorial/).

### The best foldable phone

<span class="small">***Screen:** 7.6-inch 2176p 120Hz OLED inner screen, 6.2-inch 2316p 120Hz OLED cover screen / **Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 / **Cameras:** 50-megapixel F/1.8 main with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen), four-megapixel under-display selfie (inner screen) / **Battery:** 4,400mAh / **Charging:** 25W wired, 15W wireless / **Weather resistance:** IPX8*</span>

**Samsung’s flagship foldable is** [**due for replacement soon**](/2024/6/25/24178801/samsung-unpacked-summer-2024-galaxy-z-fold-6-ring)**, so keep that in mind if you’re considering the Z Fold 5. But its multitasking capabilities remain** second to none, and it’s lighter and easier to wield than [Google’s Pixel Fold](/23773594/google-pixel-fold-review-screen-battery-hinge-camera). The narrow dimensions of the cover display make it a little awkward to use for regular phone stuff, but that’s a reasonable tradeoff considering everything that the Fold 5 can do.

There are some important things to consider, though, starting with the $1800 price. That’s what the Pixel Fold costs, too, but it doesn’t matter how you look at it — that’s a lot to pay for a phone. The Fold 5 isn’t dust-resistant, either, so you’ll want to be somewhat careful with your investment.

*The Fold 5’s unusually long-and-narrow aspect ratio when it’s closed is a turn off for some.*

Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge

The Fold 5 isn’t exactly teeming with technological improvements over last year’s model, either. There’s a new hinge that folds flat rather than with a gap between the two halves of the phone, and that’s about it. A couple of software updates that it offers will come to older Fold devices in the future, so there’s not much reason to rush out and trade in your Fold 4 for a Fold 5.

If you’re a devoted Pixel fan or averse to the Fold 5’s narrow form factor when closed, Google’s foldable might be a better choice. But for most people, the Galaxy Fold 5’s versatility and good recent track record for durability make it a better bet.

### The best phone that puts on a light show

<span class="small">***Screen:** 6.7-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / **Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 / **Cameras:** 50-megapixel F/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / **Battery:** 4,700mAh / **Charging:** 45W wired, 15W wireless / **Weather resistance:** IP54*</span>

The Nothing Phone 2 doesn’t offer the very best value proposition in its upper-midrange category. But if it’s style you’re after and something a little flashy (well, *a lot* flashy), then the Phone 2 is an easy pick.

It offers a good 6.7-inch screen, great daily performance and battery life, and a capable camera system. But that’s the usual stuff — what’s unusual about the Phone 2 is its set of LED light strips on the back panel. They illuminate in combinations called “glyphs,” and you can set them to alert you to certain notifications. It’s neat but ultimately isn’t as helpful as the system’s customizable always-on display.

*The Phone 2’s UI is on-theme.*

On the downside, the Phone 2 is only splash-resistant rather than fully resistant to water submersion like virtually all other phones over $500. It’s also not fully supported on Verizon’s network, which takes it out of contention for a lot of the US population.

If neither of the above is a deal-breaker, and the Phone 2’s styling appeals to you, then it’s an excellent choice. One thing’s for sure — it definitely stands out from the crowd.

#### Other Android phones worth considering

There are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.

-   First off, there’s the [Galaxy Z Flip 5](/23820202/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review-screen-battery-camera-hinge), a clamshell-style foldable that’s due for replacement soon, much like the Z Fold 5. The latest Flip is far more useful than its predecessors, thanks to a bigger 3.4-inch cover screen that allows you to type out texts and emails on a full QWERTY keyboard. It’s not as versatile as the Fold 5, but it also [costs a more reasonable $999](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Foldable-One-Hand/dp/B0C63N5M5H/?tag=theverge02-20). Motorola’s Razr and Razr Plus flip phones [are now in the mix](/2024/6/25/24185177/motorola-razr-plus-2024-flip-phone-screen-battery-price), too, but we’re still testing the 2024 versions.
-   On the other side of the foldable spectrum, the [OnePlus Open](/23923599/oneplus-open-review-foldable-battery-screen-camera-price) is a welcome addition to the mix with the best screen format on a book-style folding phone. It’s thin and light, and the software includes some thoughtful approaches to multitasking — a crucial part of the folding phone experience. [At $1,700](https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Open-Foldable-Device-Everything/dp/B0CHN7M531/?tag=theverge02-20), it’s just $100 shy of the Pixel Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 5 and misses a couple of key features that both of those other options include: wireless charging and an IPX8 rating. But if those omissions don’t bother you and the form factor appeals, it’s a lovely device to use.
-   Last but not least, there’s the [Google Pixel 8A](/24162073/google-pixel-8a-review-specs-price-camera). If you really want to maximize the return on your investment, it’s hard to beat Google’s latest midrange phone. It covers [all the basics for $499](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYQ916ZY/?tag=theverge02-20) while offering seven years of software support.

***Update, June 29th:** Added a mention of the Google Pixel 8A, flagged Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event, and noted Motorola’s 2024 Razr flip phones.*
