The Tesla Cybertruck’s [gigantic windshield wiper](/2023/11/10/23955489/tesla-cybertruck-windshield-wiper-investigation) isn’t working for some people — and for others, it may be the reason they can’t pick up their car. Users on [the Cybertruck Owners Club forum](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/) have reported that Tesla has been delaying Cybertruck deliveries on short notice, and wiper issues are apparently to blame.

Over the weekend, one forum user said Tesla told them the delivery pause was [due to the wiper motor](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/post-339193), while another said their delivery was pushed back [because of the blade](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/post-339196). A Reddit user said they were told their delay was due to “[a windshield wiper arm issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybertruck/comments/1dg1t5j/delivery_date_changed/l8nlgio/).” And deliveries are still being held up, with forum users [reporting](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/post-340189) [Monday](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/post-340380) that Tesla informed them of delays.

People who already have their Cybertrucks reported wiper problems in the Cybertruck Owners Club as well. One forum member, for example, [reported Friday](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/#post-338797) that their wiper wasn’t working right after they took delivery of their car and that Tesla said it would be “a few weeks” before their wiper motor could be replaced. “My wiper never worked,” [said another person](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-deliveries-suspended-temporarily-due-to-windshield-wiper-motor-issue.18736/page-2#post-338873), adding that it took them two weeks to get a replacement part. (Some users, however, say their wiper has worked without issues.)

*Drive Tesla* [reports that](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-pauses-cybertruck-deliveries-over-wiper-motor-issue/) the wiper motors are failing “due to an internal fault stemming from a supplier quality issue.” Tesla didn’t reply to a request for comment, though it [has dissolved its press office](https://electrek.co/2020/10/06/tesla-dissolves-pr-department/).

In April, Tesla issued a Cybertruck recall because of an issue that [caused the accelerator pedal to stick](/2024/4/19/24134753/tesla-recall-cybertruck-faulty-accelerator-pedal-nhtsa-defect).
