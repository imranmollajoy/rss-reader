After several months of teasing, we now know that Prime Day 2024 [will take place on Tuesday, July 16th, and Wednesday, July 17th](/2024/6/25/24145258/amazon-prime-day-dates-july-2024-sale). Fortunately, if you’re looking to get a leg up on deals ahead of the upcoming sales event, Amazon has already begun rolling out steep discounts on several of its own devices, including Echo speakers, video doorbells, TVs, ebook readers, kid-friendly tablets, and even Alexa-powered shades. The list of Prime-only deals is still relatively short for now, but it’ll explode to include thousands of products in just a few short weeks.

However, keep in mind that you must be an Amazon Prime subscriber to take advantage of any and all Prime Day deals. You can [sign up for a free 30-day trial](https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime/?tag=theverge02-20) as a new member, though, which will give you more than enough time to take advantage of the upcoming sale and enjoy other Amazon Prime benefits in the run-up to the event. Once you’re signed in to an account with an active subscription, you’ll gain immediate access to all of the deals below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right now, Prime subscribers who have never signed up for **Amazon Music Unlimited** can get five months for free at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited/?tag=theverge02-20), while non-Prime members can score three months for free. After the promotional period ends, you’ll be able to keep the bathroom mirror concerts going for the usual $10.99 a month (or $9.99 if you’re a Prime subscriber).

For those unfamiliar, Amazon Music Unlimited provides ad-free, on-demand access to millions of songs and podcasts. It features unlimited song skips and offline listening, too, which is pretty standard for premium music services. What’s not standard is the service’s support for spatial audio and [Amazon’s “Ultra HD” audio quality](/24131008/audio-quality-youtube-apple-amazon-how-to), which offers 24-bit, 192Hz streaming for 7 million tracks if you have the ears and hardware to pick up on the added detail. Over 100 million more support lossless CD-quality audio, too.

Although the entry-level **Ring Video Doorbell** isn’t the brand’s best, it’s a great value if you’re just getting your feet wet with home monitoring, especially given it’s on sale for an all-time low of [$49.99 ($50 off)](https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Venetian-Bronze-2020-Release/dp/B08N5NQ869/?tag=theverge02-20). You can also get it with a [Ring Chime for $69.99](https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Venetian-Bronze-with-Chime/dp/B09PWG8KNC/?tag=theverge02-20) ($64.99 off), allowing you to receive more traditional doorbell chimes as well as audible alerts via your phone or an Alexa device.

The newest version of the 1080p doorbell offers all the essentials to help you remotely greet visitors. It has improved night vision, motion detection, configurable zones, and two-way audio. It runs on an internal rechargeable battery, but you can also hardwire it to your existing doorbell system. It works best with a Ring Protect subscription ($4.99 a month or $49.99 a year), which allows you to record, retain, and download video events for up to 180 days. Ring’s starter plan enables alerts for people and packages, too, though you can also step up to plans that offer more useful notifications and enhanced security features (such as 24/7 emergency response).

The **55-inch Amazon Fire TV Omni** is down to $349.99 ($200 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-omni-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20), which is just $50 more than its best price to date. It’s not the QLED-bearing Omni, to be clear, nor is it the greatest TV for gamers looking to make the most of the high refresh rates on newer consoles. That said, it’s a decent TV for the money if you don’t care about any of that.

The 4K set doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR (you’ll need a 65- or 75-inch model for that), but it still supports HDR10, HLG, and relatively low input lag. There are built-in mics for hands-free Alexa voice commands, meaning you don’t always need the remote to turn the TV on and find something to watch. It also has three HDMI ports for connecting Blu-ray players, gaming consoles, and other streaming devices, one of which supports HDMI eARC for one-cable external audio for supported soundbars and receivers.

The third-gen **Amazon Echo Frames** are certainly more stylish than previous models, but they’re also somewhat expensive when they’re not on sale. Thankfully, the smart glasses have dropped to just $169.99 ($130 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Frames-3rd-Gen-Smart-audio-glasses-with-Alexa--Modern-Rectangle-frames-in-charcoal-gray--with-blue-light-filtering-lenses/dp/B09SVHP9X8?tag=theverge02-20) in all five styles with blue light filtering lenses, which beats their previous low by $55. You can also go for a pair of the Carrera, which are currently [down to $269.99 ($120 off)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL5RKSHH?tag=theverge02-20) for Prime members and available with darker shades for those who prefer sunglasses over a pair of traditional lenses.

In terms of features, Amazon’s latest Echo Frames offer decent battery life and integrated open-ear audio for calling, music, and podcasts, with a microphone for Alexa voice control. But there’s no onboard camera for easy POV snapshots and video, which you can get on similar wearables like the [Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses](/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review).

The latest **Amazon Echo Show 5 Kids** is [on sale at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5-3rd-Gen-2023-release-Kids/dp/B09B2SB77Q?tag=theverge02-20) exclusively for Prime members for $54.99 ($45 off), which is only $10 more than its Black Friday price. You can also pay $10 more and [get it **with an Echo Glow light** for $64.99](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5-3rd-Gen-Kids-with-Echo-Glow/dp/B0BZXW7MJF?tag=theverge02-20) ($64.99 off). The smart display includes one year of Amazon Kids Plus (normally $5.99 a month), which offers unlimited ad-free music, a rotating library of Audible books, and more. The 5.5-inch Show 5 is the smallest smart display Amazon sells, but it could be just enough to delight the little ones who can use it to ask Alexa for help with homework, play music, or read a bedtime story.

Amazon’s voice assistant comes with Disney-themed friends, too. You can call on Mickey Mouse, *Finding Nemo’s* Dory, Olaf from *Frozen*, and others to access unique skills, such as Disney stories or weather reports. The Echo Show 5 Kids has a camera and microphones for video calling, but there’s a mute button, a physical camera shutter, and software-based parental controls to help ensure privacy and safety when they’re not in use.

The **Blink Video Doorbell** is our [top doorbell for those on tighter budgets](/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera), and right now, Prime members can get it at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Doorbell-security-Two-year-detection/dp/B0CKM795Z7?tag=theverge02-20) with a **Blink Outdoor 4** security camera for $59.99 ($100 off). That’s the lowest we’ve ever seen on the terrific smart home bundle, which is a good starter kit for smaller homes. If you need more coverage, you can also get it with two or three cameras for [$94.99 ($144.99 off)](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Doorbell-security-Two-year-detection/dp/B0CKM699CQ?tag=theverge02-20) and [$119.99 ($199.99 off)](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Doorbell-security-Two-year-detection/dp/B0CKM5VLYT?tag=theverge02-20), respectively.

Blink’s basic 1080p doorbell supports motion detection, two-way video, night vision, and an impressive two years of battery life using two AA batteries. It lacks nice-to-have features like smart alerts and quick replies, and you can’t view live feeds on battery — you’ll need to hardwire it or add the optional [$49.99 Sync Module 2](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ?tag=theverge02-20) for that. That’s a small price to pay, however, compared to the ongoing monthly subscription other doorbells often need. The 1080p, battery-powered security cameras offer the same two-year staying power, plus similar remote vision of your property with dual-zone motion detection.

You can get an **Amazon Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle** — which comes with a leather folio cover and a power adapter — with either a [Basic Pen starting at $271.97](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG1TS4CB/?tag=theverge02-20) ($168 off) or a [Premium Pen starting at $289.97](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG17KY6P/?tag=theverge02-20) ($180 off). The Premium Pen is the better value since it has a built-in digital eraser and a shortcut button, both of which the Basic Pen lacks.

We’ve warmed up to the Kindle Scribe since first reviewing it at launch. The ebook reader’s large 10.2-inch display is great for reading, but we felt the e-reader’s note-taking capabilities lacked substance. That’s changed considerably over the past year as Amazon rolled out a slew of updates, some of which added [handwriting recognition](/2023/5/22/23729817/amazon-kindle-scribe-kobo-elipsa-2e-e-reader-stylus-digital-notebook), more pen styles, [improved notebook organization](/2023/4/24/23682206/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-kobo-elipsa-2e), and the ability to make notations directly on individual pages.

Amazon’s [invite-only deal on the **Sony WH-CH520**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSGQL41X?tag=theverge02-20) is a great opportunity to get in some early Prime Day practice. The tan model will be on sale for an all-time low of $35.99 ($44 off) on July 16th and 17th; however, you have to be a Prime member and request an invitation to purchase them. If selected, Amazon will email you details on how to complete your purchase, which is how invite-only deals will work throughout the event.

The entry-level headphones are a step down from [Sony’s WH-1000XM5](/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review) and even the [WH-CH720N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS1QCFHX?tag=theverge02-20), but that’s forgivable considering the massive price difference. You’ll miss out on active noise cancellation, and because they use an on-ear design instead of a more traditional over-ear build, you might not find them as comfortable as other models. However, they should offer solid sound quality in a pinch, along with an impressive 50 hours of battery life. They also offer support for multipoint connectivity, Google Assistant, Siri, and Google’s Find My Device network.

[Amazon is offering](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-Max/dp/B0BXLZHDNC?tag=theverge02-20) its latest [**Fire TV Stick 4K Max**](/2023/9/20/23882154/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-soundbar-announced) in refurbished condition for $29.99 (50 percent off) right now, which matches the streaming device’s all-time low. The preowned device has essentially undergone a factory reset — it’s been wiped, cleaned, and inspected — and it comes with the same one-year warranty as a new model.

The Max is the first Fire TV streaming device we’d recommend if you need a sleek option and can’t go with a set-top box like the [Fire TV Cube](/23429259/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2022-review). It’s considerably faster than the regular Fire TV Stick 4K, offers double the storage, and supports Wi-Fi 6E. It can also display artwork and widgets while idle — much like Samsung’s Frame TVs — and comes with an upgraded Alexa Voice Remote with shortcut buttons for popular streaming services.

[Apple’s last-gen iPad](/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple) makes sense for an older child’s first tablet, but if your kids are younger or your budget is really tight, [Amazon’s latest **Fire HD 10 Kids Pro**](/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro) is a good alternative. Prime members can currently get it for $109.99 ($80 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro/dp/B0BL6DCNGR?tag=theverge02-20), which beats its best price to date by $15. It comes with a year of Amazon Kids Plus, too, which provides a ton of apps, games, books, music, and other age-appropriate content.

The 2023 tablet sports a 10.1-inch full HD display, provides 13 hours of battery life, and comes with a rugged case to protect it from the eventual thrashing it’ll get. Amazon guarantees a free replacement within two years of purchase if it breaks, too. In addition to the protective hardware, you’ll get a wealth of parental controls to shield your kids from viewing unwanted content and limit the amount of time they spend on the tablet. You can even decide to remove these restrictions entirely once your child comes of age.

### A few more Prime Day deals you can shop right now

-   You can pick up an **Alexa Voice Remote Pro** at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RX4HKTD/?tag=theverge02-20) for $24.99 ($10 off) — an all-time low. The newer remote was smartly designed for usability in the dark, as it has fully backlit buttons and a remote finder feature that prompts it to emit an audible sound (if you’re within 30 feet of it), helping you figure out which part of the couch it’s fallen into. It offers one-touch Alexa access, too, and works with most newer Fire TV streaming devices as well as both first- and third-party TVs with built-in Fire TV. [Read our review](/23460954/amazon-fire-tv-alexa-voice-remote-pro-review).
-   The latest **Echo Dot Kids** is currently matching its all-time low price of $27.99 ($32 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-release-Designed-parental-controls/dp/B09B9CD1YB?tag=theverge02-20); you can also get it [**with an Echo Glow light**](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-Kids-Glow/dp/B0BF2KWMYY?tag=theverge02-20) for $37.99 ($51.99 off). The fifth-gen Dot is a smaller take on the Alexa smart speaker, one that comes in cutesy owl or dragon designs (and matching Alexa voice mods) to delight your kids. Your purchase even comes with a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the Echo Show 5 promo. [Read our review](/23426830/echo-dot-with-clock-2022-fifth-gen-review).
-   Feeling studious but don’t feel like scanning pages? You can get a three-month trial of **Audible Premium Plus** at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Books-and-Originals/b/?node=18145289011&&tag=theverge02-20) to see if audiobooks are more your style. Normally $14.95 a month, the subscription gives you one credit per month to permanently add any audiobook you want to your Audible library. You can also freely listen to a rotating list of thousands of other titles and original audio experiences.
-   A two-pack of [**Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers**](/2020/9/24/21451035/amazon-new-eero-mesh-wi-fi-gear-wifi-6-price-release-date) is going for $109.99 ($30 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-dual-band-router-extender/dp/B085WS7H6K?tag=theverge02-20), which matches the bundle’s all-time low. The Wi-Fi 6 routers work in tandem to cover homes up to 3,000 square feet with speeds up to 600 megabits. They also double as Zigbee hubs, which help compatible smart home devices neatly integrate into your network.
-   **Amazon’s newest Fire HD 8 Kids Pro** has fallen to a new low of $69.99 ($80 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-Kids-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release/dp/B09BG6DSBY?tag=theverge02-20), beating the previous record by $5. The eight-inch tablet offers 13 hours of battery life and 32GB of storage — which can accommodate quite a few games, books, and apps — but you can also add up to 1TB via its microSD slot. The ad-free tablet also comes with one year of Amazon Kids Plus and a protective case, one that’s available in three kid-friendly patterns.
-   Amazon’s **Luna Controller** is matching its all-time low of $39.99 ($30 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-Luna-Controller-1-month/dp/B0B2BZWGRK?tag=theverge02-20). The wireless gamepad is designed for use with [Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service](/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games), but you can use it with PCs, Android phones, Fire TV devices, and Apple devices via Bluetooth and USB-C. New subscribers get a month of Luna Plus for free with the deal.
-   You can get either the [Disney](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Pop-Kids/dp/B0CB9PF1N6?tag=theverge02-20) or [Marvel’s Avengers](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Pop-Kids/dp/B0CB9NS29Q?tag=theverge02-20) version of the **Amazon Echo Pop Kids** for $22.99 ($27 off) at Amazon, which matches the speaker’s Black Friday pricing; you can also get either model with an Echo Glow light ([Disney](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Kids-Disney-Princess-Glow/dp/B0CDJLGB4W?tag=theverge02-20), [Marvel’s Avengers](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Kids-Marvels-Avengers-Glow/dp/B0CDJ3DMM2?tag=theverge02-20)) for $32.99 ($46.99 off). The Echo Pop is a pared-back Echo speaker that offers the same Alexa-powered voice experience as Amazon’s bigger models. The main difference is that the Pop doesn’t sound quite as robust as the full-size Echo or Echo Dot, and it lacks the temperature and ultrasound sensors the others have. [Read our review](/23742395/amazon-echo-pop-smart-speaker-review).
