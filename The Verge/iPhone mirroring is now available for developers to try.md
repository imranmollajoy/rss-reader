Apple released new developer betas for iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia on Monday, and spokesperson Fred Sainz confirmed [on Friday](/2024/6/21/24183251/apple-eu-delay-ai-screen-mirroring-shareplay-dma) that the company planned to introduce the ability for users to [mirror their iPhone on their Mac](/2024/6/10/24170586/macos-15-mac-apple-ai-wwdc-2024#:~:text=The%20Mac%20is%20also%20getting%20iPhone%20mirroring%2C). Sainz also said the iOS 18 beta would include new SharePlay screen sharing capabilities.

The new feature, which Apple first announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month, lets you interact with your iPhone right from your Mac, meaning you can browse apps and even drag and drop files from your Mac to your phone. Your Mac will even show notifications from your iPhone, and when you click on them, your Mac can open them in the mirrored iPhone interface.

While mirroring to your Mac, your iPhone stays locked. However, if you’re using StandBy while mirroring, what’s shown on your iPhone screen will stay on the iPhone’s screen as you browse your iPhone from your Mac.

The new SharePlay features let you draw on another person’s screen or control their screen. If you want to try the developer betas for yourself, [check out our guide](/24175976/ios-18-developer-public-betas-install-how-to).
