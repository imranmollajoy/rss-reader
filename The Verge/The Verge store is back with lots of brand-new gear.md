We’ve made a lot of shirts, sweatshirts, and accessories for *The Verge* over the years. One of them said EMAILS in huge letters... for some reason. But none of them quite compare to our [newest collection](http://shop.theverge.com). We’ve developed a much smaller, curated set of high-quality apparel and accessories, all with one very simple goal: make great stuff, not just *merch*. We have some big plans for the lineup, but we’re really excited to show you what we’ve made so far.

You might notice the prices of all this new gear have gone up slightly. We’ve spent months trying to find the perfect balance of high-quality stuff and affordable prices, and we think we’ve found the best middle ground we can. And if you get in during our launch sale, it’s an even better deal — all apparel is $5 off through July 2nd (discount applied automatically).

Our new T-shirts look better and feel nicer than any we’ve made before. They’re understated, and that was very intentional. There are two designs: white with a black *Verge* monogram or black with a white monogram. (The *Verge* wordmark makes a cameo on the left sleeve.) They’re made out of 100 percent cotton, feature a ribbed collar, are pre-shrunk, and maintain a consistent fit.

The new gray *Verge* hoodie features an embroidered *Verge* monogram on the front. When you put the hood up, you’ll reveal the *Verge* wordmark underneath on the back. It’s made of 80 percent cotton and 20 percent recycled polyester fleece, so it’s super soft. For fans of pockets, there’s a kangaroo one right on the front.

We’re also offering two new accessories: a larger mug and holographic stickers. (*The Verge*’s David Pierce and Nilay Patel have been asking for larger mugs for months, so hopefully this will finally shut them up.) The new ceramic mug features a white exterior, black interior and handle, and two large *Verge* monograms, meaning you can see it — and show it off — no matter which hand you hold it with. The mug holds up to 15 ounces of your favorite beverage and is both microwave and dishwasher safe.

The *Verge* Holo Stickers come in packs of four and have a stunning multicolor holographic look. These are perfect for your laptop, water bottle, notebook, or really anything that you like to slap stickers on. Put a bunch on your new mug. We won’t stop you!

Today, we are also launching our second product collaboration with Nomad. You can learn more about our new limited-edition Blurple Sport Band for the Apple Watch [here](/e/23945143).

As we continue to build out the *Verge* apparel collection, our goal is to make cool products with partners we like, including more creators and startups. We’ll keep this line of essentials around all the time and then do limited-edition drops. We have some fun ideas about bringing back our favorite old designs, too. (We’re choosy about who we work with, and of course, these partnerships will never affect our coverage of these or any other companies and products.)

If there’s something you’d like to see us make or an item or design you wish we had on sale, let us know in the comments! We hope we see you repping your new *Verge* gear soon.
