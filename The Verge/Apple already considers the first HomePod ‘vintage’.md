Apple says the iPhone X, first-generation AirPods, and first-generation HomePod are now considered “vintage,” [as reported by *MacRumors*](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/iphone-x-homepod-and-original-airpods-now-vintage/). So, if you own a first-generation HomePod — or multiple, like the person I sold my HomePod to in 2022 — it might sting to hear that Apple already considers the six-year-old speaker “vintage.”

Apple’s vintage label technically [refers to products](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772) that it stopped distributing between more than five and less than seven years ago, and fortunately, you can still get service for vintage products from Apple and authorized repair shops. But Apple seems to be moving the [original HomePod](/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker) on a faster track, given that it only [discontinued the product three years ago](/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini). Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

Apple isn’t yet considering the first-gen HomePod, [first-gen AirPods](/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review), or [iPhone X](/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review) “obsolete” — Apple won’t service hardware after that milestone, which it says applies to products the company stopped distributing more than seven years ago. But if you have multiple OG HomePods around your house and they need repairs — I hope that’s not the case for the person who has my old HomePod! — you might want to figure those out sooner rather than later. (I’m sure Apple would prefer if you upgraded to the [HomePod Mini](/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review) or [second-gen HomePod](/23578606/apple-homepod-2-second-gen-2023-siri-smart-speaker-review).)

We should also pour one out for the first-gen AirPods and the iPhone X. The iPhone X, released in 2017, looked great and was Apple’s first phone to have Face ID. And those first AirPods, which came out in 2016, were arguably the first true wireless earbuds that were a big hit; I remember picking up a pair right after they launched and being really impressed.
