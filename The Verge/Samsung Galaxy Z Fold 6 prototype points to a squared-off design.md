We already have a sense of potential [specs for](/2024/6/14/24178341/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-seems-like-a-minor-upgrade) the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, but now we might have a closer look at the foldable’s design, too. Images [shared by reliable leaker Ice Universe](https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1801446432211390695) show a prototype of the Z Fold 6 with sharper edges and a slight change to its camera design, as [reported earlier by *9to5Google*](https://9to5google.com/2024/06/14/prototype-unit-photos-show-off-galaxy-z-fold-6s-boxier-design/).

The look of the dummy model tracks with the leaked [marketing materials](https://9to5google.com/2024/06/05/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-leaked-ad/) and [renders](/2024/2/28/24085509/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-foldable-leaked-renders-rumored-july-unpacked) we’ve seen so far, which show off a similarly boxy design and black rings around each rear camera sensor instead of silver. You can see how the Galaxy Z Fold 6 may compare to the Galaxy Z Fold 5 in the below image from Ice Universe.

In addition to the slight design changes, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 might not differ much from its predecessor specs-wise. The device is expected to come with the same 120Hz OLED 7.6-inch display when unfolded, while the cover display gets a small bump from 6.2 inches to 6.3, according to leaked specs [shared by *Smartprix*](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-specs-leak-ahead-of-paris-unpacked/).

It’s also rumored to come with an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and up to 1TB of storage. The camera setup may remain unchanged as well, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens.

Despite the minor changes, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could come with a price increase. A [leak from *Smartprix*](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/breaking-samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-us-pricing-variants-revealed/) suggests that it will start at $1,899.99, making it $100 more expensive than the Galaxy Z Fold 5. But we’re not going to have to wait much longer to find out more about Samsung’s upcoming devices, as [signs are pointing](https://x.com/evleaks/status/1801615700018040980) to a July 10th Galaxy Unpacked.
