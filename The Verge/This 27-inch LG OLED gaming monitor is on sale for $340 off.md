OLED monitors are on a nice (albeit, still slow) trajectory toward lower prices. If you’re in the market for a gaming-centric OLED for your PC, check out the excellent **LG UltraGear 27-inch 27GR95QE-B** currently selling for $656.99 ($340 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LG-UltragearTM-Monitor-nVIDIA%C2%AE-Compatible/dp/B0BRBW8KRK?tag=theverge02-20) and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1745626-REG%2Flg_27gr95qe_b_27_ultragear_curved_oled.html) or $659.99 at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmsFh5YsdmP).

This LG model may not be gargantuan or capable of native 4K, but its modestly sized 27-inch OLED panel has crisp QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution. It’s got the deep blacks and strong color contrast you expect in an OLED, and since it’s designed for gaming, it can reach up to 240Hz over its DisplayPort 1.4 or twin HDMI 2.1 ports — making it a great choice for pulling double-duty if you use both PC and current consoles at your desk. In fact, it has a built-in downscaler to ensure all the 4K content from a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or high-end gaming PC looks excellent.

If 27 inches seems too small and the 16:9 aspect ratio too mundane for such fancy panel technology, you can also check out the larger ultrawide **34-inch LG UltraGear 34GS95QE-B curved OLED** selling for $819.99 ($480 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LG-34GS95QE-Ultragear-DisplayHDR-DisplayPort/dp/B0CV27X9K7?th=1&tag=theverge02-20) and [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmsFhmo5kH5). It’s pricier, sure, but it carries similar specs in a 21:9 aspect ratio with about seven inches of extra screen width.
