Netflix has scheduled [*Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef*](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F81743617) on September 2nd as another one of its live events, along with [Christmas Day NFL games](/2024/5/15/24157289/netflix-nfl-game-streaming-global-christmas-day), WWE [*Monday Night Raw*](/2024/1/23/24047785/netflix-monday-night-raw-exclusive-live-streaming-leaving-cable), and the [delayed](/2024/6/7/24173618/netflix-mike-tyson-jake-paul-boxing-match-new-date) Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight.
