On Monday, Meta [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media/#:~:text=Update%20on%20July%201%2C%202024%20at%207%3A00AM%20PT%3A%C2%A0) that it is “updating the ‘Made with AI’ label to ‘AI info’ across our apps, which people can click for more information,” after [people complained that their pictures had the tag applied incorrectly](/2024/6/24/24184795/meta-instagram-incorrect-made-by-ai-photo-labels). Former White House photographer Pete Souza pointed out the tag popping up on an upload of a photo originally taken on film during a basketball game 40 years ago, speculating that using Adobe’s cropping tool and flattening images might have triggered it.

“As we’ve said from the beginning, we’re consistently improving our AI products, and we are working closely with our industry partners on our approach to AI labeling,” said Meta spokesperson Kate McLaughlin. The new label is supposed to more accurately represent that the content may simply be modified rather than making it seem like it is entirely AI-generated.

The problem seems to be the metadata tools like Adobe Photoshop apply to images and how platforms interpret that. After Meta [expanded its policies around labeling AI content](/2024/4/5/24121978/meta-ai-generated-content-label-requirements-deepfakes), real-life pictures posted to platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Threads were tagged “Made with AI.”

You may see the new labeling first on mobile apps and then the web view later, as McLaughlin tells *The Verge* it is starting to roll out across all surfaces.

Once you click the tag, it will still show the same message as the old label, which has a more detailed explanation of why it might have been applied and that it could cover images fully generated by AI or edited with tools that include AI tech, like Generative Fill. Metadata tagging tech like [C2PA](/2023/10/10/23911381/adobe-ai-generated-content-symbol-watermark) was supposed to make telling the difference between AI-generated and real images simpler and easier, but that future isn’t here yet.
