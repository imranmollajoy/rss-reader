Nintendo finally shared gameplay footage of *Metroid Prime 4: Beyond* during Tuesday’s Nintendo Direct. The brief video was classic *Metroid Prime*, featuring intense first-person gunfighting *and* scanning stuff in the environment. Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait a little while until we can play it for ourselves, as the company gave a vague 2025 release window for the title.

We’ve been waiting a very long time for any scraps of information about the next entry in the beloved *Metroid Prime* series. The game was first revealed [on June 13th, 2017](/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017), with [just a logo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnFbDmTjS_MI), and when Nintendo announced that it was [rebooting the title](/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date) in January 2019, [its video](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzLIv_UXI_So) didn’t contain any footage of the game itself. When it said it was restarting development, Nintendo revealed that the original developers of the series, Retro Studios, would be taking over.

Since the announcement of *Prime 4*, however, there has been lots of new *Metroid* to play. *Metroid Dread* was an [excellent return to the series’ 2D roots](/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch), and *Metroid* fans got a treat in 2023 when Nintendo [shadow-dropped *Metroid Prime Remastered*](/2023/2/8/23591768/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-launch)*. Remastered* turned out to be an [incredible remake](/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic) of my favorite game of all time, and it got me very excited for *Prime 4*.
