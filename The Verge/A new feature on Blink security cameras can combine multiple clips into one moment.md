Budget smart security camera company Blink is adding a neat trick to its app: [Blink Moments](https://support.blinkforhome.com/en_US/video-clips/moments) automatically stitches together relevant clips from multiple cameras into a single video. The idea is to make it easier to see what’s been going on around your home and also to share it with friends and family — or the police — depending on what you captured.

Moments, which has been in beta testing, started rolling out on June 4th and will be available to all Blink users with multiple cameras in the next few weeks, according to the company. Besides multiple cameras, it requires a [Blink Subscription Plus Plan](https://support.blinkforhome.com/795440) ($10 a month or $100 a year) but doesn’t require Blink’s [Sync Module](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ?tag=theverge02-20) hub.

According to Blink, Moments are generated when two or more cameras on the same system record motion-activated clips or saved [Live View clips](https://support.blinkforhome.com/en_US/video-clips/how-to-save-live-view-on-blink-cameras) within 45 seconds of the start time of the last recorded clip. The clips are then stitched together into one video that can be shared from the Blink app.

This could be a useful feature, as if you have multiple cameras it can be tricky to manually scroll through dozens of clips to see what’s been going on. Because Blink only offers motion and person detection, there are fewer ways to filter clips to find what you’re looking for, and the Moments feature could offer a glanceable way to view all the action.

Blink, which is owned by Amazon, isn’t the only camera company with this type of capability. Eufy’s [cross-camera tracking is a similar concept](/2023/9/26/23890980/eufy-security-cross-camera-tracking-ai-solocam-floodlight-doorbell) and doesn’t require a subscription — although it does need a [Eufy HomeBase 3](https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Expandable-Compatibility-Encryption/dp/B0BZCCB56G?tag=theverge02-20&ascsubtag=___vg__p_23655021__t_w__r_https://www.google.com/__d_D&tag=theverge02-20), which costs $150. It will be interesting to see if a Moments-style feature comes to [Blink’s sister brand Ring](https://ring.com/collections/home-security-cameras) at some point, too.

According to Blink, Moments will work with all current and prior generations of Blink’s battery-powered, wired, and plug-in cameras, and if you add new cameras, they’ll automatically integrate with the feature.

Blink’s current flagship camera is its $90 [Blink Outdoor 4](/2023/8/24/23843590/blink-outdoor-4-security-camera-wireless-person-detection) battery-powered camera ($120 with a required Sync Module). It can last up to an impressive [two years on two AA batteries](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1FW0BJ/) or up to four years with the [expansion battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Blink-Outdoor-Battery-Extension/dp/B0B9YQPGK8?tag=theverge02-20). The company also sells a $40 plug-in [Blink Mini 2](/24100149/blink-mini-2-review), a [wired floodlight camera](/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera), and a wired / battery-powered [video doorbell](/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera#:~:text=Blink%E2%80%99s%20Video%20Doorbell%20is%20the%20best%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20looking%20a%20budget%2Dfriendly%20buzzer%20that%20offers%20motion%2Dactivated%20recording%20and%20alerts%2C%20night%20vision%2C%20two%2Dway%20audio%2C%20and%20up%20to%20two%20years%20of%20battery%20life.). All of these cameras support the Moments feature.

***Update, June 18th:** Added that a Blink Sync module is not required for Moments.*
