AMD is looking into a potential cyberattack. A threat actor that goes by the alias “IntelBroker” is selling data that it claims was obtained from an AMD.com breach this month, [*BleepingComputer* reports](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amd-investigates-breach-after-data-for-sale-on-hacking-forum/), and the company confirmed in a statement that it’s looking into the purported theft. IntelBroker claims that the data for sale includes future products, employee databases, and customer databases.

“We are aware of a cybercriminal organization claiming to be in possession of stolen AMD data,” AMD said in the statement given to *BleepingComputer*, [*PCMag*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/amd-investigates-possible-breach-amid-hackers-sale-of-company-data), and [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-18/amd-is-investigating-claims-that-company-data-was-stolen-in-hack). “We are working closely with law enforcement officials and a third-party hosting partner to investigate the claim and the significance of the data.”

AMD didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from *The Verge*. In the past, IntelBroker has attempted to sell data allegedly stolen from [Europol](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/intelbroker-nabs-europol-info-agency-investigating), [The Home Depot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/home-depot-confirms-third-party-data-breach-exposed-employee-info/), and the [health insurance marketplace DC Health Link](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-investigates-data-breach-impacting-us-house-members-and-staff/).

In 2022, AMD confirmed it was investigating claims that the hacking group RansomHouse [stole 450GB of data](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/28/amd-extortion-ransomhouse/).
