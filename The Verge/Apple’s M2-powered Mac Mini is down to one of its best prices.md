Apple may have released a bunch of [new and improved laptops](/24092910/apple-macbook-air-m3-first-impressions) over the last few months, but the Mac Mini remains a solid desktop machine if you just need a basic computer for your home. And right now, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHGTPMV?tag=theverge02-20) is selling the latest [**M2-powered Mac Mini**](/23566070/apple-mac-mini-m2-pro-2023-review)** **with the upgraded 512GB of storage for $689.99 ($110 off), which is just $10 shy of its all-time low price. You can also still buy the base model for $499 ($100 off) with a 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGHGXR?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmxNWIR6BFM), and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1746353-REG%2Fapple_mmfj3ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html).

If you’re looking for a desktop that’s more than capable of powering through everyday tasks, the Mac Mini is a good option. It’s a fast performer that’s even capable of some light video work, but it also offers a good port selection — including Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C and USB-A ports, an ethernet port, and an HDMI port. Add in futureproof specs like Wi-Fi 6E along with the old yet beloved 3.5mm headphone jack, and all in all, the desktop machine is a solid upgrade over its predecessor. Just bear in mind you’ll have to supply your own monitor, keyboard, and mouse, though you could easily buy those with the $110 you’re saving.
