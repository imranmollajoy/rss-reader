Gmail is getting more AI features that could make it easier to stay on top of your email.

On the web, Google is beginning to roll out a new Gemini side panel that can do things like summarize email threads and draft new emails. The tool will offer “proactive prompts” but you can also ask “freeform questions,” [Google writes in a blog post](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-gmail.html), and it’s “built to leverage Google’s most capable models,” such [as Gemini 1.5 Pro](/2024/2/15/24073457/google-gemini-1-5-ai-model-llm). In the Gmail mobile apps, Google will also give you the ability to have Gemini summarize threads.

These improvements could be useful, but they’ll only be available to paid Gemini users: you’ll need to be a Google Workspace customer with a Gemini Business or Enterprise add-on, a Gemini Education or Education Premium add-on, or a [Google One AI Premium](/2024/2/10/24068539/google-one-100-million-subscribers-g-suite-ai-premium-gemini) subscriber. I’d also caution against fully relying on these tools for work; given that AI sometimes [hallucinates things](/2024/5/15/24154808/ai-chatgpt-google-gemini-microsoft-copilot-hallucination-wrong), make sure you’re double-checking an important email Gemini helps with before you send it.

Google is also rolling out Gemini features to the side panel in Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive. Google promised [last month at I/O](/2024/5/14/24155310/google-gemini-ai-sidebar-gmail-docs-slides-io) that these features were on the way. And there are still some announced AI features to come for Gmail, [including “Contextual Smart Reply.”](/2024/5/14/24156500/google-gmail-ai-gemini-summaries-contextual-smart-reply)
