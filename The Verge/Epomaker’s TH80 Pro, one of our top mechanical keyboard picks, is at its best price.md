With RGB lighting and customizability, most mechanical keyboards are way more fun to type on than your regular old keyboard. Those perks typically come at a cost, though — but not as much today because **Epomaker’s TH80 Pro** is on sale at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/EPOMAKER-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard-Capacity/dp/B0BMKBMCS2?tag=theverge02-20) for $62.99 ($27 off). That’s a new all-time low price on the TH80 Pro and is available on keyboards with Gateron switches in select colors — including black, red, and yellow — as well as with Budgerigar switches.

If you’re on a budget, the Epomaker TH80 Pro is our top affordable [mechanical keyboard pick](/23384750/best-mechanical-keyboard-wired-wireless-75-percent-layout-cheap-bluetooth#:~:text=LOFREE%20FLOW.-,An%20affordable%20wireless%2075%20percent%20keyboard,-%E2%86%B4). The 75 percent mechanical keyboard doesn’t feel as high-end as some of the pricier picks in our mechanical keyboard buying guide, and its software isn’t as slick. Nevertheless, it still offers a fantastic typing experience and a good set of features for its price, like hot-swappable switches and keys you can remap via software for greater customizability. The keyboard even features a handy volume knob and slick per-key RGB lighting along with multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless via a dongle.
