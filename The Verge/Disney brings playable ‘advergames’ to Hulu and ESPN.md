Disney is sprinkling a [new kind of playable ad](https://press.disneyadvertising.com/disney-delivers-slate-of-new-streaming-ad-innovation-to-fuel-greater-interactivity-and-engagement) across Hulu and ESPN. The new ad format, called “advergames,” will let you interact with the ads using your remote, as reported [earlier by *Adweek*](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/disney-advergames-shoppable-ads/).

You might see two different advergames to start: *Quiz Show* and *Beat the Block*. While *Quiz Show* presents a series of trivia questions, *Beat the Block* challenges viewers to land golf balls into specific targets using their remote. Of course, they’re branded experiences, as the *Beat the Block* ad features branding for Topgolf, and the *Quiz Show* [game will prominently display](https://www.brightline.tv/quiz-show#static) an ad for a company while you play.

The pitch for this format is that it gives advertisers feedback on whether viewers actually noticed their content — plus, more kinds of ads mean more money for streamers. In its most recent earnings report, [Disney’s streaming business inched closer](/2024/5/7/24150986/disney-streaming-business-earnings-q2-2024) to profitability after drawing more users to its ad-supported tier.

Disney is partnering with the streaming TV company BrightLine to enable the new playable ad formats. It has also brought shoppable ads to Disney Plus made by Kerv, which show QR codes that link you directly to a product page. As noted by *Adweek*, shoppable ads are programmatic, meaning advertisers purchase the ads automatically, and an algorithm will decide who to show them to and when.

On ESPN, the ads seem inevitable, at least for now, but on Disney’s other streaming platforms, your only option to avoid the ads is to pay a bit more each month.
