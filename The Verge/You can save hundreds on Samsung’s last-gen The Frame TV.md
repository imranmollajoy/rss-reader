If you plan on relaxing this summer by sitting back with a cold drink and streaming the Olympics and your favorite shows, it’s worth investing in a TV that isn’t an eyesore. **Samsung’s The Frame TV** is one of the most stylish TVs on the market, and through June 29th, you can buy the last-gen model from Woot in the 43-inch and 50-inch sizing for [$687.99 ($300 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-qled-the-frame-tv-previous-model-4?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_4) and [$837.99 ($460 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-qled-the-frame-tv-previous-model-4?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_4), respectively, which are their lowest prices to date. It’s also on sale in the massive 85-inch configuration for [$2,497.99 ($1,800 off)](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-qled-the-frame-tv-previous-model-4?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_4), which is one of its best prices.

As with the current 2024 lineup, the last-gen TV showcases artwork from around the world when idle. The screen’s colors aren’t as sharp as the newer model’s, but its anti-glare matte display still makes the art resemble an actual canvas. Yet, when switched on, The Frame transforms into a 4K QLED TV with support for several streaming apps. Granted, it doesn’t have the pristine image quality of an OLED display and lacks VRR for gaming, but it still offers a speedy 120Hz refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 support. It’s also compatible with major smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, making it a good overall TV if you want to stream the summer away in style.
