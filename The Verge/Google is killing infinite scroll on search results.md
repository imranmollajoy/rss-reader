The latest feature [headed to the Google graveyard](/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning) is continuous scrolling on search results, according to a [report from *Search Engine Land*](https://searchengineland.com/google-dropping-continuous-scroll-in-search-results-443529). The user experience, which mirrored the endless scrolling behavior of social media feeds, was originally [introduced for search results on mobile devices](/2021/10/14/22726625/google-search-results-continuous-scrolling-mobile-doomscroll) in October of 2021 and then [brought over to desktop search results](/2022/12/6/23495973/google-search-desktop-continuous-scrolling) in late 2022.

A Google spokesperson reportedly [told *Search Engine Land*](https://searchengineland.com/google-dropping-continuous-scroll-in-search-results-443529) that continuous scroll is being removed today from desktop search results, while the feature will be removed from mobile results “in the coming months.”

In its place on desktop will be Google’s classic pagination bar, allowing users to jump to a specific page of search results or simply click “Next” to see the next page. On mobile, a “More results” button will be shown at the bottom of a search to load the next page.

[Google told *Search Engine Land*](https://searchengineland.com/google-dropping-continuous-scroll-in-search-results-443529) that “this change is to allow the search company to serve the search results faster on more searches, instead of automatically loading results that users haven’t explicitly requested.”
