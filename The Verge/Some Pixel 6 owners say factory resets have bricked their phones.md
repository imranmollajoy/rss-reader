Some folks are reporting being left with bricked Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and 6A phones after they factory reset them. Google is aware of the issue and is investigating, [according to a comment](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/281577056?hl=en&msgid=282534526) from a member of the Pixel support forums’ [product expert program](https://support.google.com/communities/answer/9138806?hl=en).

Users in the forum thread, which was [spotted by Indian tech outlet *Tech-Issues Today*](https://techissuestoday.com/pixel-6-bricking-after-factory-reset-google-investigating/), say that after attempting to reset their phone, the phone doesn’t boot, throwing up an error message:

> “Cannot load Android system. Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all user data stored on this device.”

The phone offers the option to try again, which reportedly fails, or try a factory reset again, but during the wipe, a separate error says the phone is missing a file called tune2fs, which appears to refer to a Unix command line tool used to set file system parameters.

Some people reported seeing the issue [after](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/254605774/pixel-6-hard-bricked-can-any-one-help-me?hl=en) [updating](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1dcjypf/tune2fs_is_missing_error/) their phones, but the complaints seem to stem from a factory reset, not a specific software update. One Reddit member cobbled together complaints about the issue across all three Pixel 6 phones, and some of those who have experienced it say they [can’t recover the phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1dl750l/pixel_6_pro_soft_bricked/) using Google’s [official tools](https://flash.android.com/welcome?continue=/back-to-public) [for doing so](https://pixelrepair.withgoogle.com/).
