Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. [It recently discontinued the M1 MacBook Air](/2024/3/4/24090015/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air-leaving-behind-its-iconic-wedge-design) to make room for the [M3 Air](/2024/3/4/24089999/apple-macbook-air-m3-announced-13-15-inch), but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $699 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro. Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but, thankfully, finding a deal on a current M3-based model is actually not that difficult.

Although Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. [Apple’s refurbished store](https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac&subid1=vergedeals030724) provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.

But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.

### The best MacBook Air deals

#### M1 MacBook Air

The [**M1 MacBook Air**](/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon) was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to discontinue it. But while the [redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air](/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review) (which has been with us for a while as well) seems poised to take over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been fully dethroned in our [guide to the best laptops](/21250695/best-laptops).

The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has [committed to keeping it around](/2024/3/15/24101727/apple-m1-macbook-air-laptop-walmart) for the foreseeable future and is currently [discounting it to $699](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889&subid1=vergedeals040224) ($300 off). The M1 Air may be a few years old now, but it’s still hard to beat in terms of value, especially when it comes to everyday performance and battery life.

#### M2 MacBook Air

As for the fancier [**13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip**](/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review), the base model with 256GB of storage and an eight-core GPU recently received a price drop. It started at $1,199 originally before [falling to $1,099 last year](/2023/6/5/23739220/apple-macbook-air-15-features-specs-price-release-date-wwdc-2023), and now, its pricing starts at the same $999 that the original M1 model did.

As for deals, the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is currently on sale starting at $829 ($170 off) in select colors at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y?tag=theverge02-20) and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1710305-REG%2Fapple_mly33ll_a_13_6_macbook_air_m2.html). The model with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, meanwhile, is down to $1,049 ($150 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0B3C5HTGG?tag=theverge02-20) or $1,049 ($150 off) at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cl3CaLhtLS7) and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1710300-REG%2Fapple_mlxx3ll_a_13_6_macbook_air_m2.html), which is one of the better prices we’ve seen on the step-up model.

The M2 MacBook Air is a super slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor didn’t kick-start a revolution like the M1 generation, it’s a great performer for any user, including more demanding creatives.

It does have some slight downsides, though, including [slower storage in the base 256GB configuration](/2022/7/1/23191141/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2-base-model-slow-device) and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop offered by Apple since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the [best laptops](/21250695/best-laptops).

The [**15-inch MacBook Air with M2**](/23757441/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-2023-review) is a lot like a blown-up 13-inch Air, and judging from our glowing [review](/23757441/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-2023-review), there’s nothing wrong with that. Like its smaller counterpart, it has an M2 chip, two Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C ports, MagSafe charging, and its base model comes with a 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. But it differs by having a larger, 15.3-inch notched screen with 2880 x 1864 resolution, six speakers instead of four, a 10-core GPU that costs extra on the 13-inch, and a higher starting price of $1,299. Bumping up to a larger, faster 512GB of storage will run you $1,499.

As of right now, Best Buy is offering the best deals on the larger MacBook Air, including the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is on clearance for [$999.99 (about $299 off)](https://howl.me/cmoUpsIzmBf). You can also get it at [Best Buy](https://howl.me/cmdVJMx19gc) in select colors with a 512GB SSD for an additional $200.

#### M3 MacBook Air

The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the [**M3 MacBook Air**](/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review) to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13- and 15-inch variants simultaneously this time, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099.

Thankfully, the base MacBook Air 13 with an M3 chip, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for an excellent $899 ($200 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=theverge02-20). A slightly lower discount is available on the 8GB RAM / 512GB SSD model, which drops it to $1,129 ($170 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX22NCHQ?tag=theverge02-20). As for the 15-inch Air, the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is going for $1,129 ($170 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX23GFMJ?tag=theverge02-20) in select colors.

### The best MacBook Pro deals

During its [“Scary Fast” event](/2023/10/30/23933672/apple-event-mac-october-news-updates-products-scary-fast) last October, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaces the 13-inch M2 model. That means the [Touch Bar Mac is finally dead](/2023/10/31/23938841/apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-discontinued-proof-of-concept), replaced by Apple’s new M3-based MacBooks. Thankfully, the latest models are relatively easy to find on sale.

#### M3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro

The new entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The [**14-inch M3 MacBook Pro**](/23944344/apple-macbook-pro-14-2023-review-m3-specs-battery-ports) has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).

The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Fortunately, the base model with 512GB of storage and 8GB of RAM is currently on sale for its all-time low at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-8%E2%80%91core-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5JLWJK?tag=theverge02-20), where you can pick it up for $1,399 ($200 off).

The **14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros** of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by [the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model](/23949207/apple-macbook-pro-16-m3-max-review-price-specs), which cost an eye-watering $7,199.

While these models are still quite new, versions that actual humans buy have begun receiving the occasional discount. For instance, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5LN355?tag=theverge02-20) is currently selling the 14-inch MacBook Pro in space black with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD for $1,699 ($300 off). As for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and 512GB — it’s down to $2,199 ($300 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-12%E2%80%91core-18%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5BL45N?tag=theverge02-20) and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1793621-REG%2Fapple_mrw43ll_a_16_macbook_pro_m3.html).

### The best Mac Mini deals

The latest [Mac Mini](/23566070/apple-mac-mini-m2-pro-2023-review) comes in a base configuration with Apple’s M2 processor or in a more powerful configuration with the M2 Pro. It’s one of the most affordable yet performant desktop computers you can get (as long as gaming isn’t your priority). The M2 Mac Mini starts with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $599, while the M2 Pro model features a superior processor plus gigabit ethernet, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,299.

The latter model also features an expanded port selection, from two USB-C ports to four. It’s almost like getting an M2 Pro-powered MacBook Pro 14, but in desktop form. However, keep in mind that buying any Mac Mini means you have to provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Either way, the M2 Mac Mini remains a great value for a desktop computer.

Right now, the base model with an M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is on sale for $499 ($100 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGHGXR?tag=theverge02-20) and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1746353-REG%2Fapple_mmfj3ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html), which is an increasingly common sale price and only $20 more than its best price to date. You can also get it with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $699 ($100 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGTPMV?tag=theverge02-20).

If you want to maximize its potential, you can upgrade to the M2 Pro version with a 10-core CPU / 16-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,199 (a solid $100 off) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHFS6XX?tag=theverge02-20) and [B&H Photo](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1746367-REG%2Fapple_mnh73ll_a_mac_mini_with_m2.html).
