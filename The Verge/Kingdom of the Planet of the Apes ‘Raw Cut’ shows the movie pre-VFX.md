[*Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*](/2024/5/10/24152293/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review)’ stunning visual effects are nothing short of astounding, but for the film’s upcoming home release, 20th Century Studios is giving you the ability to see the motion capture performances that were key in bringing the talking apes to life.

Though *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* will be available to download on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, and Fandango at Home starting on July 9th, you might want to wait until the movie’s physical release on August 27th when the 4K Ultra HD featuring *Inside the Lens: The Raw Cut* is in stores.

In an announcement about *The Raw Cut*, 20th Century Studios described it as a full-length, split-screen alternative cut that will allow viewers to see what the film looks like before its VFX are finished. In addition to spotlighting actors’ performances beneath the film’s VFX, *The Raw Cut* will also include optional commentary tracks from director Wes Ball, editor Dan Zimmerman, and VFX supervisor Erik Winquist.

Unfortunately, it seems like *The Raw Cut* won’t be included on Blu-ray and DVD copies of *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* (which will also be out on August 27th), but if it’s something you need to see, now might be the time to hop on [the UHD bandwagon](/24046669/4k-blu-ray-streaming-physical-media-bitrate-picture-audio-quality-collector).
