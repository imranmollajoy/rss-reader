[Nomad](/24181102/verge-nomad-apple-watch-band) is running an [overstock sale](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/collections/overstock-sale) of various accessories on its site, and an especially notable one is its original **Base One Max 3-in-1 MagSafe Charger** — offered in [black](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-one-max-3-in-1-carbide-gen-1) or [silver](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-one-max-3-in-1-silver-gen-1) for $95 ($55 off) or in an extra-fancy [gold](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-one-max-gold) “limited edition” for $120 ($30 off).

This is the original, [first-gen model from last year](/2023/9/5/23854508/nomad-base-one-max-3in1-magsafe-charger-iphone-apple-watch-airpods-price-specs) that simultaneously charges a MagSafe iPhone, Apple Watch, and compatible AirPods (or other wireless charging-capable earbuds). It’s got a weighty heft to it, being made of a mix of aluminum and glass, and it’s nearly identical to the revised model that Nomad released soon after, which added Apple Watch fast charging. Faster charging for Apple Watch Series 7 and newer models is a nice feature, but that updated Base One Max runs a [much costlier $170](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-one-max-3-in-1-carbide). Ouch.

Even at the first-gen Base One Max’s discounted price you can definitely spend less to get a simple 3-in-1 wireless charger, though many of them out there are only “MagSafe Compatible,” meaning they top out at 7.5W on even the latest iPhones. The MagSafe pad portion of the Base One Max charges an iPhone at up to 15W speeds, and it’s Qi-compatible, so you can rest non-magnetic iPhones and even Android phones on it for a slower trickle charge. Also, the Base One Max is one of the nicer-looking designs out there, if you value a simplistic aesthetic and premium materials.
