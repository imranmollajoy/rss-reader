Google has [announced on its Pixel Help Community](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/279861132/extended-repair-program-for-pixel-8) portal that it’s extending the [Pixel 8’s](/23912370/google-pixel-8-pro-review-camera-assistant-magic-editor-best-take-audio-eraser) repair program for phones displaying vertical lines and exhibiting flickering. This policy update allows Pixel 8 owners to get this problem fixed under warranty, for up to three years after purchase, if their phone “Exhibits a vertical line running from the bottom of the display to the the top or a display flicker.”

Google isn’t promising that every phone with the issue will qualify, though — Google or an authorized repair partner will need to determine that it qualifies for the extension based on the serial number of your phone.

The Pixel 8 Pro is not included in this repair extension, though there are user claims out there that [it can exhibit vertical lines of its own](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1893yq5/pixel_8_pro_vertical_lines_on_screen/).

Google has a history of users experiencing [glitches](/2023/2/27/23617338/pixel-7-pro-6-pro-6a-crash-youtube-video-alien), [bugs](/2024/1/31/24057675/google-has-a-convoluted-fix-for-the-latest-pixel-storage-bug), and [other oddities](/2021/11/1/22757639/google-pixel-6-pro-phone-off-screen-flickers-fix-december-update) in Pixel phones — even dating back to some of the [earliest Pixel generations](/2017/10/22/16518298/google-investigating-pixel-2-xl-screen-burn-in) and [their Nexus forebears](/2019/4/11/18306552/google-huawei-nexus-6p-class-action-lawsuit-settlement-agreement-compensate). In fact, shortly after the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro launched in late 2023, [users reported ripple-like physical defects](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-8-display-bumps-3387522/) appearing in their displays.

Google’s standard hardware warranty still only lasts one year without such an extension, even though the company now promises seven years of software OS and security updates on all Pixel 8 phones, including the cheaper [Pixel 8A](/24162073/google-pixel-8a-review-specs-price-camera).
