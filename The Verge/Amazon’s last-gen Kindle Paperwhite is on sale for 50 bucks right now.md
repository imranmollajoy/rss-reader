Lately, it seems as though the biggest happenings in the E Ink world revolve around large note-taking devices like the [Kindle Scribe](/23484927/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-notetaking-pen-review) and color offerings such as the apt-titled [Kobo Libra Colour](/2024/4/10/24124411/kobo-libra-colour-clara-colour-e-reader-kindle-e-ink). That said, if you’re looking for a basic ebook reader to burn through your summer reading list, there’s nothing wrong with picking up a last-gen e-reader like the **2018 Kindle Paperwhite** — which happens to be [on sale at Amazon (via Woot)](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Generation-Waterproof-Ad-Supported/dp/B09V8F3P91/?tag=theverge02-20) in used condition with ads for $49.99.

Amazon’s last-gen Paperwhite has become more difficult to find since the arrival of the [2021 model](/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books), even if it isn’t a dramatic step down in terms of features. It still carries an* *IPX8 rating for full resistance against water immersion, as well as a crisp six-inch, 300ppi display and support for Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth headphones. The newer Paperwhite sports a bigger display and better backlighting — not to mention wireless charging, if you [opt for the 32GB Signature Edition](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20) — but it rarely drops below $100 in price, even when on sale. The real travesty here is the fact that the 10th-gen Paperwhite only offers a mere 8GB of storage in its base configuration and uses Micro USB for charging instead of USB-C, which, even in 2018, felt like a miss.
