We’re closing in fast on June 16th, which means Father’s Day is right around the corner. If you haven’t already nabbed a gift for your pops or any other dads in your life, well, you’re starting to cut it close. But don’t fret; we’ve got some excellent last-minute gift ideas to consider.

The annual celebration of all things dad is often filled with campy and played-out gifts like ties, socks, and overtly macho power tools. Our [Father’s Day gift guide](/24153276/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas-2024-dad-tech-gadgets) offers plenty of inspiration for last-minute shoppers, but if you need a shortcut, we’ve rounded up some alternative ideas below, along with a few discounted picks ripped directly from our gift guide. Of course, to qualify as one of these “last-minute deals,” they must be discounted and slated to arrive in time, so be sure to double-check the shipping details if you’re concerned about timing.
