Philips Hue’s [next smart bedside lamp](/2024/6/12/24176834/phillips-hues-new-bedside-lamp-has-a-jaunty-angle) will reportedly be called the “Twilight.” The lamp will feature two buttons on top for power, scene selection, and sleep automation, and it also has LEDs in the back that will feature a sunrise or sunset effect, [according to HueBlog.com](https://hueblog.com/2024/06/13/philips-hue-twilight-more-details-about-the-bedside-lamp/).

The rear LED and main light, like [the Hue Dymera](https://hueblog.com/2024/01/26/multi-source-light-technology-how-hue-combines-multiple-light-sources/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMulti%2Dsource%20light%20technology%20enables,in%20a%20perfectly%20harmonised%20way.%E2%80%9D)’s top and bottom lights, will apparently be individually controllable, and when triggering its sleep automation, the site says it will simulate a sunset before turning off. It’s not clear yet when — or for how much — Philips will release the Twilight.

[HueBlog published leaked images](https://hueblog.com/2024/06/12/first-images-of-a-philips-hue-bedside-lamp-leaked/) earlier this week that show the lamp’s odd, fixed lampshade. It will apparently come in black or white and stand “around 33 centimetres high.” The article includes images published by the [German smart home site Smartlights.de](https://www.smartlights.de/news/philips-hue-twilight-das-ist-die-neue-nachttischlampe/).

Philips might also have a new 5-meter (about 16 feet) lightstrip called the Hue Solo on the way, as it was briefly listed by “a major American retailer” for $89.99 before being taken down, according to a [story HueBlog published yesterday](https://hueblog.com/2024/06/14/hue-solo-lightstrip-affordable-light-strip-is-ready-for-launch/). And there is indeed a [cached Best Buy Hue Solo product page](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.bestbuy.com/site/philips-hue-solo-lightstrip-5m-white-and-color-ambiance/6584308.p?skuId%3D6584308&sca_esv=68f81806ac2eb1bf&udm=14&ei=kcZtZtLxDZT9ptQPhf664AU&ved=0ahUKEwiS_pXZiN6GAxWUvokEHQW_DlwQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=cache:https://www.bestbuy.com/site/philips-hue-solo-lightstrip-5m-white-and-color-ambiance/6584308.p?skuId%3D6584308&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAicmNhY2hlOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlc3RidXkuY29tL3NpdGUvcGhpbGlwcy1odWUtc29sby1saWdodHN0cmlwLTVtLXdoaXRlLWFuZC1jb2xvci1hbWJpYW5jZS82NTg0MzA4LnA_c2t1SWQ9NjU4NDMwODIFEAAYgAQyCBAAGIAEGLEDMgsQABiABBixAxiDATINEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiKBTIIEAAYgAQYsQMyCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyCBAAGIAEGLEDMgsQABiABBixAxiDAUiWQlCUDVi4MHABeAGQAQCYAVqgAbIDqgEBNrgBA8gBAPgBAfgBApgCB6ACyAPCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICChAAGIAEGEMYigXCAgoQABiABBixAxgKwgIQEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiDARiKBZgDAIgGAZAGCJIHATegB6gd&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) that describes a “seamless blend of multicolor light in a single LED strip” and says it can be controlled via Bluetooth.
