It’s summer, which means it’s time for sun and speedruns. The 2024 edition of Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ), the annual speedrunning marathon for charity, kicks off on Sunday and runs until July 6th. [This year’s lineup](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48) is once again packed with runs for some of my favorite games, including *Balatro*, *Alan Wake 2*, *Elden Ring, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1, 2, 3, and 4* (all in one run), a glitchless [*Baldur’s Gate 3* Honour Mode](/2023/11/30/23982661/baldurs-gate-3-patch-5-details) run, and a shipless *Outer Wilds* run (how???).

But my most anticipated run is a live speedrun from Peanut Butter, the shiba inu who performed a remote run of the NES game *Gyromite* at [Awesome Games Done Quick in January](/24040350/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-how-to-watch-twitch). At SGDQ, Peanut Butter will be live at the event playing *Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball* for the Super NES. Peanut Butter’s goal is to win a game in 30 minutes. The run is scheduled for July 4th at 8:43PM ET.

SGDQ’s first run, *Yoshi’s Story*, happens today at 1PM ET. You can stream the entire event from [the Games Done Quick Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick), and Games Done Quick typically posts runs after they happen [on its YouTube channel](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40gamesdonequick). The event, which will be streamed from Minneapolis, is raising money for Doctors Without Borders.
