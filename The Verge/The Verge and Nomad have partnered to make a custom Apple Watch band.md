We like nice things here at *The Verge —* and we know you do, too. That’s why we’re teaming up with a variety of partners to create delightful new products. Last year, we launched our [first product collaboration with dbrand](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fspecial-edition%2Fthe-verge), and now we’re back with our second.

Meet the limited-edition Blurple Sport Band from *The Verge* and Nomad. Nomad is one of the best mobile accessory makers, and the company’s [Sport Bands](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/collections/bands-rugged-sport) have particularly stood out among a sea of junky rubber straps. We wanted to introduce a new way for you to wear *The Verge*, so we combined our iconic branding with Nomad’s excellent bands.

The Blurple Sport Band is made out of the same high-quality FKM rubber that Nomad’s existing bands use. It’s durable, waterproof, resistant to oils, and easy to clean. If you use your Apple Watch to work out, this is the strap you need — especially if you’re pressing play on *The Vergecast* or *Decoder* when you hop on the treadmill.

The minimalist design is easily adjustable and very breathable, thanks to channels in the interior of the band. It features a pin-and-tuck closure to keep it looking sleek while remaining secure. The aluminum pin also features *The Verge* wordmark on the inside.

*The Verge* x Nomad Blurple Sport Band is available starting today for Apple Watches in 49mm, 45mm, 44mm, and 42mm sizes. You can order it now from [Nomad’s website](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-blurple) for $60.

This is only one part of *The Verge*’s new product plans. We’re also introducing a [revamped merch store experience](/e/23946688) with a curated collection of [higher-quality *Verge* apparel and accessories](https://shop.theverge.com/). Deck yourself out in *The Verge* by pairing the Blurple Sport Band with one of our slick new tees or a sweatshirt. We can’t say for sure that wearing *The Verge* will instantly make all your batteries last longer and your Instagram posts get more likes — but either way, you’ll look and feel great.
