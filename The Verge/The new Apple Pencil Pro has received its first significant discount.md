Unfortunately, if you’re looking at picking up the [new iPad Pro](/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review) or [Air](/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024), you’re going to have to pay to upgrade your second-generation Apple Pencil, too. After all, the new tablets are only compatible with the new Apple Pencil Pro, but thankfully, today, there’s a deal to offset the cost slightly. Right now, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=theverge02-20) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-Pro-Advanced-Tools-Pixel-Perfect-Precision-Tilt-Pressure-Sensitivity-Industry-Leading-Low-Latency-Note-Taking-Drawing-Art-Attaches-Charg%2F5762417070) are selling the new [**Apple Pencil Pro**](/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features) for $119 ($10 off), which is the best price we’ve seen and the first real discount on the stylus since its debut.

Apple might have launched the [more affordable USB-C Apple Pencil](/2023/10/17/23919994/apple-pencil-stylus-usb-c-price-updates) last year, but it lacks support for Find My and advanced creative features, like pressure sensitivity and double-tap tool switching. It also comes with new capabilities the second-gen Apple Pencil lacks, like the new “Barrel Roll” gyroscope, which lets you quickly turn your digital pen or brush by twisting the stylus as you draw. Apple also added a useful new squeeze gesture, which lets you switch between software functions so you can quickly navigate between menus and other tools you often use and even [control your smart home](/2024/5/15/24157115/you-can-control-your-smart-home-by-squeezing-apples-latest-pencil). And of course, with [the release of iPadOS 18](/2024/6/10/24140821/apple-ipados-18-features-updates-apps-wwdc-2024) later this year, you’ll be able to do even more with the stylus, like solving math problems after writing them out.
