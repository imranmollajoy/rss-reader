Capcom is developing a new *Resident Evil* game, *Resident Evil 7* director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed during [a summer “Capcom Next” livestream on Monday](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dp7hiMS0Hct4).

“We’re making a new *Resident Evil*,” Nakanishi said during the show. “It was really difficult to figure out what to do after *7*. But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial. I can’t share any details just yet but I hope you’re excited for the day I can.”

That’s admittedly not much to go on, but I get the sense he’s hinting that this new game is the next major entry in the franchise. If that’s the case, we’ll have to see if Capcom calls it *Resident Evil 9* or finds some sort of clever subtitle, like it did with the logo for [*Resident Evil Village*](/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc).

The news of a new *Resident Evil* followed updates for a few other games. The [just-announced](/2024/6/26/24186570/dead-rising-rises-from-dead-again) *Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster* will be [released on September 19th](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFIAiUWhxmrs) with improved graphics and some new quality-of-life upgrades. *Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess*, a new tower defense game in a setting inspired by Japanese mythology, is getting a demo today ahead of its July 19th release. (My colleague Ash Parrish was a big fan of the game [at Summer Game Fest](/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games).) And *Resident Evil 7* for iOS, which launches [on July 2nd](/2024/6/10/24175360/resident-evil-7-biohazard-re7-apple-mac-iphone-ipad-ios), will have an auto-fire feature to make the game easier to play with virtual controls.
