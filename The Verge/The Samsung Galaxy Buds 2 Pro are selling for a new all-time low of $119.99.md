Samsung’s excellent [**Galaxy Buds 2 Pro**](/23312192/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review) wireless earbuds have fallen to a new low price, selling for just $119.99 ($110 off) at [Woot](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-1). That’s a screamer of a deal if I’ve ever seen one, as these flagship noise-canceling earbuds from Samsung are exceptionally light and comfy and sound great.

Samsung includes some extra features for Galaxy phone owners to take advantage of, like 24-bit audio, spatial audio head tracking, and auto-switching among Samsung devices, but anyone can enjoy how good these compact buds sound. And at this price, you’d normally be shopping for a midrange earbud like the third-gen AirPods, not something in the “Pro” tier with ANC. We’ve regularly seen the Buds 2 Pro fall as low as $160 (which is still a good value), but this blows away previous deals by a fair margin. Plus, Woot is offering all three colors for the duration of the deal — which is set to run for five more days (ending Saturday, June 22nd) or until the earbuds sell out.
