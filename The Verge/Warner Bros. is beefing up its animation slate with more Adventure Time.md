As part of [Warner Bros. Discovery’s](/2024/5/9/24152677/lord-of-the-rings-2026-warner-bros-peter-jackson) big plan to [double down on previously established IP](/2022/11/4/23440706/warner-bros-discovery-zaslav-hbo-max-cancellations), the studio has ordered a slate of new projects spun off from the worlds of [*Adventure Time*](/2016/9/29/13105272/adventure-time-ending-finale), *Regular Show*, and *Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends.*

Timed to Warner Bros.’ presentation at this year’s Annecy Festival, Cartoon Network Studios announced today that it has greenlit a number of new projects including an *Adventure Time* film as well as series spun off from *Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends* and *Regular Show*. [*Variety* reports](https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/regular-show-fosters-adventure-time-scooby-doo-1236034978/) that *Steven Universe*’s Rebecca Sugar, *Over the Garden Wall*’s Patrick McHale, and *Adventure Time* showrunner Adam Muto are all attached as members of the new film’s creative team.

In addition to the movie, Cartoon Network Studios is also producing *Adventure Time: Side Quests* and *Adventure Time: Heyo BMO*, two shows aimed at younger viewers that will bring back a number of the original show’s classic characters, like Finn the Human and the Ice King.

Cartoon Network Studios seems to be especially keen on courting the preschool audience, as it has also tapped Craig McCracken to revive the *Foster’s Home* IP with *Foster’s Funtime for Imaginary Friends* — a show about young imaginary friends learning the ins and outs of their whimsical world. And while the studio has yet to announce any details, J.G. Quintel is currently working on a new *Regular Show* project that may bring back a number of characters from the original show.
