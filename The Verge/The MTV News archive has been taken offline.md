The archives of the *MTV News* website, which had remained accessible online after the unit was shut down last year by parent company Paramount Global, have now been completely taken offline. As [*Variety* reported](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/) yesterday, both [mtvnews.com](http://mtvnews.com) and [mtv.com/news](http://mtv.com/news) now redirect visitors to the MTV website’s front page.

In May of last year, Showtime / MTV Entertainment Studios president and Paramount Media Networks groups CEO Chris McCarthy [announced layoffs for 25 percent of its employees](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/mtv-news-shuts-down-paramount-layoffs-showtime-networks-1235607638/) and said that *MTV News*, whose staff had already been reduced by previous layoffs, would be shutting down entirely.

Although the *MTV News* website was no longer publishing new stories, its extensive archive, dating back over two decades to its launch in 1996, remained online. But as former staffers discovered yesterday, that archive is no longer accessible. Patrick Hosken, who served as a music and news editor at *MTV News* for eight years, [shared their frustration with the decision on X](https://x.com/patrickhosken/status/1805327863882956850):

[According to *Variety*](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/), Paramount Global also took down the archives of *MTV News* sister site CMT.com last week, which featured several decades’ worth of journalism focused on the country music industry.
