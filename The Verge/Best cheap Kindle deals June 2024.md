When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.

Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the [Kindle Scribe](/23484927/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-notetaking-pen-review), Amazon looks to be moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.

Below, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or any of the products, but we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Also, keep in mind that Amazon [will hold its annual Prime Day celebration in July](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-day-july-2024). Historically, we tend to see great deals on Amazon devices — including Kindles — during the two-day event, so it may be worth it to wait if you’re able to do so.

### The best Kindle (2022) deals

#### What does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?

Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.

In case you missed it, Amazon [announced a new entry-level Kindle](/2022/9/13/23350735/amazon-kindle-usb-c-display-screen-features) in 2022, one that was designed to replace the [2019 model](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Now-with-Built-in-Front-Light/dp/B07DPMXZZ7/?tag=theverge02-20). The latest Kindle — which starts at $99.99 — puts Amazon’s base e-reader more in line with the most recent Kindle Paperwhite, providing a number of quality-of-life improvements in the process. The 2022 model features longer battery life, a 300ppi screen, and charges via USB-C instead of Micro USB. It also touts 16GB of storage by default and comes in a “denim” color, which resembles the soft blue you might associate with jeans.

In the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $74.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited included. Right now, however, you can only buy the Kindle at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR67MQLG/?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://howl.me/ck9fWORUGmZ), and [Target](https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-6-34-e-reader-black-2022-release%2F-%2FA-86976936) for its full retail price of $99.99, or [with ads, a power adapter, and a fabric cover starting at $134.97](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFCGK6CM/?tag=theverge02-20) ($15 off). Regardless of whether you choose the standalone model or the bundle, the entry-level Kindle remains a worthwhile option if you’re looking to pick up an e-reader for less than the latest Paperwhite.

### The best Kindle Kids (2022) deals

The latest base Kindle wasn’t the only e-reader Amazon introduced in 2022. The entry-level model arrived alongside a new Kindle Kids, which is identical to the standard model but comes with a handful of accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $119.99.

In terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the *Percy Jackson* and *Harry Potter* series — at no additional cost.

In late March, we saw the Kindle Kids sell for $99.99, which is $20 shy of its all-time low and the cheapest we’ve seen it go for since Black Friday. Right now, however, there are no deals currently available, meaning you can only buy the e-reader at its full retail price of $119.99 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Kids-2022-release-worry-free/dp/B0BLJ6LJBM?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://howl.me/clUIjo3R3kK), and [Target](https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-kids-6-34-e-reader-2022-release-ocean-explorer%2F-%2FA-88678172).

### The best Kindle Paperwhite (2021) deals

Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its [11th-gen model](/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date), which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger 6.8-inch display. The e-reader launched more than two years ago, and it often receives steep discounts at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, particularly around Black Friday and throughout the holiday season.

When it first launched in 2021, the latest Kindle Paperwhite arrived in two entry-level configurations: an 8GB model with ads for $139.99 and an 8GB model without ads for $159.99. These days, though, it’s hard to find either in stock, and the [16GB ad-supported version ($149.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TMN58KL/?tag=theverge02-20)) and the [ad-free version ($169.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDCMBKB4/?tag=theverge02-20)) tend to be more widely available. There’s also a [32GB ad-free Signature Edition for $189.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20), which is identical to the standard Paperwhite only it features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed.

Amazon also rolled out a [Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $169.99](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-thousands-worry-free/dp/B0BL8S6ZPT?tag=theverge02-20), which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.

Unfortunately, the standalone Paperwhite with 16GB of storage is only available for $149.99 (full price) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDCCG44G?tag=theverge02-20), [Best Buy](https://howl.me/clRKdu5F34k), and [Target](https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-34-16gb-e-reader-with-adjustable-warm-light-black%2F-%2FA-86976934). That being said, you can save $20 when you buy two [Kindle Paperwhite Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-thousands-worry-free/dp/B0BL8S6ZPT?tag=theverge02-20). Alternatively, you can grab the 8GB Paperwhite as part of a package that includes a power adapter and your choice of a fabric cover for [$174.97 ($20 off)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FBXR5Q8/?tag=theverge02-20), a [leather cover for $181.97 ($20 off)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FC2CDGF/?tag=theverge02-20), or a [“cork” cover for $189.97 ($20 off)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FBYNC2J/?tag=theverge02-20).

As for the 32GB ad-free Signature Edition, it’s available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-kindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20) and [Best Buy](https://howl.me/ck9fXQIuBFI) right now for $189.99 — its regular retail price. However, you can buy the ad-free Signature Edition with 32GB of storage, a wireless charging dock, and a leather cover on sale at Amazon for [$244.97](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature-Essentials-including/dp/B09FP1C94R?tag=theverge02-20) ($20 off). You can also buy the e-reader with a [cork cover and a wireless charging dock for $252.97](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20) ($20 off) or a [fabric cover and a wireless charging dock for $237.97](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNJZD68/?tag=theverge02-20) ($20 off).

### The best Kindle Scribe deals

The ad-free Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader to date — one that also represents a departure from past Kindle models. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300 dpi, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles have become known. What separates the Scribe from other models, however, is that it comes with one of two styli, which can be used to annotate books, doodle, or jot down notes. We found the e-reader’s note-taking capabilities lacking in our testing, but Amazon has already started to improve the software via free OTA software updates, helping bring it up to speed with other E Ink competitors.

We recently saw the Kindle Scribe drop to an all-time low price of $239.99. However, right now you can only buy it at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQPS527F/?tag=theverge02-20) and [Target](https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-scribe-10-2-34-16gb-e-reader-gray%2F-%2FA-88410166) in its 16GB base configuration with a Basic Pen and three months of Kindle Unlimited for its full retail price of $339.99. That being said, [Amazon is offering a $40 discount](https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A3PQP3DNTDJ063?ref=psp_pc_cart_collapse&tag=theverge02-20) when you purchase two. You can also save money when you buy the 16GB Kindle Scribe with a [leather cover and a power adapter for $379.97 ($60 off)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG1TS4CB/?tag=theverge02-20). Meanwhile, the bundle with the Premium Pen, which offers a shortcut button and a built-in eraser, is currently on sale in the 16GB configuration with a folio cover and a power adapter starting at [$409.97 ($60 off)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG17KY6P/?tag=theverge02-20).

### A note on the Kindle Oasis

Up until recently, Amazon also sold the [2019 Kindle Oasis](/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display). Along with a 7-inch 300ppi E Ink display, the Oasis was unique in that it offered physical, page-turning buttons. Sadly, however, the waterproof ebook reader is neither on sale nor in stock in new condition at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07F7TLZF4?tag=theverge02-20) or any other major retailer. The international version of the e-reader is currently [available at Amazon for $135 (half off)](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07L5GDTYY/?tag=theverge02-20), though it may not be worth buying at this point. Amazon won’t ship it to US addresses, and more notably, the Oasis is [no longer listed as part of Amazon’s official Kindle lineup](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=6669702011&ref=MARS_NAV_desktop_kindl_shopdvcs&tag=theverge02-20). That suggests that Amazon may have discontinued it and that we may see a newer version at some point in the near future.
