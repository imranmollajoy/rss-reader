Intel’s Thunderbolt 5 might be the best USB-C cable ever, [with 120Gbps of single-direction bandwidth, 240 watts of power, and enough oomph](/2023/9/12/23869802/intel-thunderbolt-5-launch-specs) to drive external SSDs, eGPUs, and high-resolution, high-refresh-rate monitors from a single cable at unheard-of levels. But first, it’d have to ship! Today, Cable Matters is shipping the [first three certified Thunderbolt 5 cables](https://www.newswire.com/news/cable-matters-launches-the-world-s-first-thunderbolt-5-cable-with-22160961), which bring us one big step closer to something practical instead of theoretical.

Available today from Amazon in [1-foot (0.3m)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2PK1ZQ2?tag=theverge02-20), [1.6-foot (0.5m)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP8LLC8N?tag=theverge02-20), and [3.3-foot (1m) lengths](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP8K1C59?tag=theverge02-20) for $23, $27, and $33, respectively, the new cables obviously don’t do anything on their own — you’d need a computer with a Thunderbolt 5 port and a dock or accessory of some sort to get some real use out of it.

But as of today, the only laptop we’ve heard of with a Thunderbolt 5 port [is the Razer Blade 18](/2024/1/8/24029132/behold-the-first-thunderbolt-5-port-weve-seen-on-an-actual-pc), and even there, it’s not guaranteed. You’d have to buy [the $4,500 Mercury edition](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-18%2FRZ09-05092EM4-R3U1) of the laptop to get that port. (You do also get an Intel i9 and a mobile RTX 4090 for the money.)

And unless you own *two* of those laptops, there’s still probably nothing special you can do with a Thunderbolt 5 cable as of today because [the peripherals we saw at CES](/2024/1/7/24029398/we-finally-touched-thunderbolt-5-and-qi2-but-not-meaningfully) aren’t yet ready: Belkin, J5Create, OWC, and Sabrent do not yet list any of those Thunderbolt 5 products on their websites, and Hyper still shows [its $400 dock](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-next-thunderbolt-5-dock) as being out of stock with a “Sign up to be notified” button.

But if you *do* have two of the exact same $4,500 Razer laptops, could you [use Thunderbolt Share](/2024/5/15/24156519/intel-thunderbolt-share-app) to transfer files between them at ludicrous speed? Inquiring minds want to know. If not, I suppose you could use it as a USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 cable for now.

According to Cable Matters’ press release, its cable is manufactured by Lintes, the same company that provided the prototype cable we saw at CES.
