Larry Hryb, aka “Major Nelson,” has his next job. Following [his departure from Microsoft last year](/2023/7/14/23795326/xbox-major-nelson-larry-hryb-microsoft), where he was a public face for the Xbox brand, Hryb will be joining Unity’s Community team, he announced on Monday.

At Microsoft, he, among other things, hosted the *Official Xbox Podcast* and posted about Xbox to his [large following on X](https://x.com/majornelson). On LinkedIn, he lists his new job title as “Director of Community,” and based on a LinkedIn post, it seems like he’ll still be a brand ambassador in some form.

“Unity’s mission of empowering creative and business success of creators around the world across games, apps, and experiences aligns with my lifelong passion for innovation and community building,” [Hryb wrote in the post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208490348510085120/). “I am eager to collaborate with the talented developers and creators who use Unity’s tools to bring their visions to life. Together, we’ll continue to transform the way stories are told and experiences are shared.”

Unity could use some help building its reputation back up. Last year, the company pissed off developers with [a new pricing scheme](/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development) that it [changed in response to outcry](/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update). (Shortly after, former CEO John Riccitiello announced [he would be stepping down](/2023/10/10/23911338/unity-ceo-steps-down-developers-react), and Unity said in May that former Zynga and EA exec Matthew Bromberg [would be its new CEO](https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2024/Unity-Appoints-Matthew-Bromberg-as-New-CEO/default.aspx).) Unity also announced layoffs [affecting about 25 percent of its employees in January](/2024/1/8/24030695/unity-layoff-staff-25-percent).
