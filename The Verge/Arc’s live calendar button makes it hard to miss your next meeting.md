The Arc browser is getting [a nifty new Live Calendar feature](https://arc.net/e/DD1FEC13-D73D-4EAE-8233-883A3FE1D564) that presents your next Google Calendar meeting on the sidebar just before it starts so you won’t miss any important calls. It includes a countdown timer and a Google Meet join button that you can see and access without opening your Calendar tab.

To set up Live Calendar, first make sure you’re updated to the latest version of Arc (version 1.47.1). Then, just open Google Calendar in Arc, log in, and drag the tab into the favorites section directly under the URL. With Google Calendar pinned, you’ll get a new “Live Calendar Available” message confirming the feature is active. You can right-click on the Google Calendar favorite tab to change Live Calendar settings, like how soon you want the next meeting link to appear and the ability to hide the time until the next meeting in case countdowns make you anxious.

Arc [already had](https://arc.net/integrations/google-calendar) a Google Calendar tooltip feature that let you hover over the tab to see a preview of your upcoming meetings and a button to join them. However, it hasn’t displayed reliably for some *Verge* staff who use Arc daily. The new Live Calendar feature will hopefully solve that by essentially becoming a widget that you won’t need to hover over.
