Dear Tarnished, it’s time to travel back to the Lands Between — but you don’t have to pay full price.

[*Elden Ring*’s](/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc) long-awaited [*Shadow of the Erdtree* DLC](/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc) officially launches tomorrow, June 21st, and both returning and new players can save on either the expansion or a cost-effective bundle with the base game. Fanatical is selling the PC (Steam) version of [*Shadow of the Erdtree* for $35.19](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13797872?sid=vergeroundupdeals062024&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fdlc%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree) (about $5 off) as well as a [digital bundle with the base game for $70.39](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-8836598-13797872%3Fsid%3Dvergeroundupdeals062024%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-edition) (about $9 off / $30 cheaper than buying them separately at full price). Purchasing either option through Fanatical nets you an emailed code to redeem on Steam.

These prices are slightly better than similar discounts out there from fellow third-party retailers like CDKeys and Eneba, making it the cheapest way to currently jump into FromSoftware’s dark fantasy RPG (at least on PC). However, the sale on the DLC itself is set to expire today, June 20th, at 6PM ET / 3PM PT, which is [actually when *Shadow of the Erdtree* unlocks for PC players](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-unlock-time/#:~:text=For%20PC%20players%2C%20Elden%20Ring,for%20a%20lot%20of%20us.). (Yes, you get it a little early, you lucky ducks.)
