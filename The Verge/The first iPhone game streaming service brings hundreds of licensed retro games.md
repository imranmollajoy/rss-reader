Apple opened the door for game streaming services in its App Store following the implementation of the [European Union’s Digital Markets Act](/24040543/eu-dma-digital-markets-act-big-tech-antitrust) (DMA) last year, but the first such service that will [arrive on iOS and iPadOS next week](https://www.antstream.com/apple) will cater to hardcore retro gamers, as [pointed out by *Cult of Mac*](https://www.cultofmac.com/860288/antstream-arcade-launches-on-app-store/).

Antstream, which is already available on several platforms like Xbox, Windows, Android, and Amazon devices, boasts a catalog of over 1,300 retro games that can be played on demand, including *Missile Command*, *Sam & Max Hit the Road*, *Asteroids*, and *Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi*.

There are now [several excellent retro gaming emulators](/2024/5/14/24156818/so-many-ios-emulators) available for Apple’s mobile devices, including [Delta](/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast), [RetroArch](/2024/5/15/24157472/retroarch-emulator-ios-app-store-iphone-nintendo-sega-playstation-atari), and [PPSSPP](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903), which focuses on the PlayStation Portable. The challenge with these emulators is that they don’t include any games. They rely on ROMs, digital copies of classic video games, that are plagued with complicated legal questions when it comes to using and acquiring them.

Antstream features a library of legally licensed retro titles that’s similar to the [Evercade lineup](/2020/5/28/21271988/evercade-retro-games-handheld-review-classic-atari-namco-interplay) of gaming consoles, so users don’t have to visit the dark corners of the web to source their own.

There are [hundreds of titles from ancient platforms](https://www.antstream.com/games) like the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum, and the Commodore Amiga, but you’ll find just 28 Atari 2600 games, five from the Game Boy, two from the original PlayStation, and 42 from the Super Nintendo. So, even with 1,300-plus games offered through the Antstream service, you might have to dig a little to find something you’ll actually want to play.

As much as we enjoyed the *Super Star Wars* trilogy on the SNES, that might not be enough to justify the price of an Antstream subscription. For a limited time after launching on the App Store on June 27th, subscriptions will be discounted to $3.99 per month or $29.99 per year, which is just slightly cheaper than the standard $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year that Antstream usually charges.
