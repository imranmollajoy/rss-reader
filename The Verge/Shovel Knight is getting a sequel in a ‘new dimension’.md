Shovel Knight might be bouncing into 3D. Developer Yacht Club Games just announced a new mainline game in the hit series that started as a retro-inspired 2D platformer, and the studio says this new game will “launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming,” [according to a blog post](https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/what-s-next-for-shovel-knight/).

If that wasn’t enough of a clue about the move to 3D, the Yacht Club Games’ Friday livestream celebrating the 10th anniversary of *Shovel Knight* featured an even more pointed hint: a 3D version of the Yacht Club Games logo.

The studio is staying mum about many specifics — there’s no release window — but did tease that “the game will bring electrifying action, richer mechanics, and all the timeless charm you expect from a *Shovel Knight* title.”

While you wait for that new game, Yacht Club Games will have a lot of new things you can play. The studio also [announced *Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX*](https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-shovel-of-hope-dx-announcement/), the “definitive edition” of the original *Shovel Knight* title that adds things like online multiplayer, stereoscopic 3D, a rewind power, in-game cheats, and the ability to play as 20 different Shovel Knight characters. Yacht Club Games says the game is “coming soon.” [*Shovel Knight Dig*](https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-dig-wicked-wishes-launches-summer-2024/) and [*Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon*](https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-pocket-dungeon-paradox-pack-releases-summer-2024/) are also getting free DLC this summer.

The developer also shared [new footage of *Mina the Hollower*](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db5MbAFiFlOA), its upcoming game that looks to be heavily inspired by the Game Boy classic *The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. Mina* also has a vague “coming soon” launch date, and I look forward to a more specific release window — the game looks fantastic.
