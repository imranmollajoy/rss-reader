Midnight Society, the game studio co-founded by Dr Disrespect, has terminated its relationship with the streamer. In a post on X, [the studio wrote](https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355), “On Friday evening, we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder’s Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect.”

That is the day and time that former Twitch employee Cody Conners [posted a tweet about](https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676) the alleged reason for Beahm’s permanent ban, saying it was for “sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product.” Robert Bowling, a former Infinity Ward developer and fellow Midnight Society co-founder, posted shortly after, [saying](https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1804390727541305548), “I’m now aware and I’m dealing with it... I landed from Stockholm, reconnected, saw the tweet and immediately began an investigation to learn everything I need to know so I can ensure a full follow through.”

On Sunday, *The Verge* reported a second Twitch employee who worked on the platform’s trust and safety team at the time of the incident [had come forward to corroborate Conner’s post](/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation).

“We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act,” reads the post from Midnight Society. “For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately.”

The announcement came barely an hour after Beahm [ended his first stream](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2FE73nGJocgAA%3Fsi%3DWPtWVjG5lcitonh5%26t%3D11574) since the allegations surfaced. In the stream, Beahm said that he was “fatigued” and was considering “removing himself from the scene.” He suggested that he could leave Midnight Society as part of that process. “Maybe I step away from there, too,” he said.

In 2020, [Beahm was banned from Twitch](/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given) at the height of his popularity and shortly after signing a two-year exclusivity contract with the platform. Neither Twitch nor Beahm would [state the reason why](/2020/7/16/21326873/dr-disrespect-interviews-twitch-disappearance-stream), leading to four years of mystery and speculation. On Friday,

Beahm [denied the allegations in posts to X](https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878). “I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid,” he wrote on Saturday.

In 2021, Beahm [co-founded Midnight Society](https://venturebeat.com/games/robert-bowling-dr-disrespect-and-others-create-midnight-society-studio/) with Bowling and Quinn DelHoyo, who worked on the *Halo* and *Gears of War* series. In 2022, [Midnight Society announced *Deadrop*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/08/02/dr-disrespect-reveals-deadrop-his-fps-along-with-the-first-real-gameplay-footage/), an extraction shooter that, at one time, [sold NFTs as a part of its monetization strategy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/05/31/dr-disrespects-midnight-society-is-going-hard-on-nfts-with-polygon-partnership/?sh=3d6658d6552e).

In its post announcing its termination of Beahm, Midnight Society wrote, “While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.”

***Update, June 24th:** Added post from Robert Bowling and clarified Midnight Society’s post.*
