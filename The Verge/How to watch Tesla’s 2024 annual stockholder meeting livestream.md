Tesla is holding its annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, today, where investors will decide the fate of CEO Elon Musk’s [enormous $50 billion compensation package](/2024/6/12/24177128/tesla-elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote).

The event is not just about Musk’s payday. Tesla’s board is portraying it as a pivotal moment in the company’s effort to secure Musk’s attention span, which is divided between X Corp., SpaceX, Neuralink, and his other companies. It also hinges on the question of whether Musk can [steer Tesla back on track](/24134781/tesla-q1-2024-earnings-sales-market-share-elon-musk).

From the looks of things, Musk may [get exactly what he wants](/2024/6/13/24177638/elon-musks-50-billion-pay-day-is-nigh): both the money and the reincorporation of Tesla in Texas in retaliation of [a Delaware judge voiding Musk’s package](/2024/4/17/24132827/tesla-elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote-delaware) are on track to pass by wide margins, Musk claimed in a post on X.

Meanwhile, Musk is also facing a new lawsuit [alleging sexual harassment and retaliation](/2024/6/12/24177095/spacex-elon-musk-sexual-harassment-lawsuit) at SpaceX. And institutional investors have said they plan to vote against the pay package, calling it excessive. Will the vote go the other way? Will someone question Musk’s alleged behaviors? Watch it live here.

Tesla’s “Cyber Roundup” Annual Shareholder Meeting will take place on Thursday, June 13th, at 4:30PM ET / 3:30PM CT / 1:30PM PT.
