Motorola’s [tracking tag](/2024/6/14/24178695/tag-motos-it) is officially here, and if you’ve wanted an AirTag for your Android phone, this new Moto Tag might be it. This item tracker costs $29 and works with [Google’s newly upgraded Find My Device network](/2024/4/8/24124174/android-find-my-device-network-offline-tracker-tag-chipolo-pebblebee) to help you locate a lost item. In addition to Bluetooth, it also offers ultra wideband, which means that if your phone is equipped with a UWB chip — like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra — you can track down the tag’s precise location. You know, just like you can with an AirTag.

The Moto Tag comes with an IP67 rating, so it should survive a dunk in fresh water. The tag is powered by a CR2032 coin cell battery and should last a full year before it needs a new one. And in the event that you have your tag on hand but can’t find your phone, pressing a button on the Moto Tag will ring your phone to help you find it. The multifunction button can also be used as a remote shutter for your Motorola phone’s camera.

It also seems that the Moto Tag will work with cases designed to hold an AirTag; according to Motorola’s press release, the tag was “designed specifically to fit perfectly with most third-party accessories already on the market so that users can easily attach it to all their valuables.”

There you go — AirTag, but make it Android. The Moto Tag will go on sale on August 2nd; you can buy one for $29 or a four-pack for $99.
