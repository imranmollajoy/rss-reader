[Matter is a new smart home interoperability standard](/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer) designed to provide a common language for connected devices to communicate locally in your home without relying on a cloud connection. It is built to be [secure and private](https://csa-iot.org/developer-resource/white-paper-matter-security-and-privacy-copy/), [easy to set up](/23823041/matter-thread-device-setup-smart-home-how-to), and widely compatible.

Developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung (and [others](https://csa-iot.org/members/)), Matter is an [open-sourced](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip), IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol [Thread](/23165855/thread-smart-home-protocol-matter-apple-google-interview) and currently supports over 30 device types. These include lighting, thermostats, locks, refrigerators, dishwashers, dryers, ovens, smoke alarms, air quality monitors, EV chargers, and more.

A smart home gadget with the Matter logo can be set up and used with any Matter-compatible ecosystem via a [Matter controller](/23390726/matter-smart-home-faq-questions-answers#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Matter%20Controller%3F) and controlled by them simultaneously, a feature called [Multi-Admin](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/all-about-choice-multi-admin-in-matter-gives-users-more-flexibility-and-unlocks-smart-home-innovation/).

Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some major smart home platforms supporting Matter, along with hundreds of device manufacturers.
