Car dealerships hamstrung by outages following two cyberattacks against CDK Global in June might finally be able to use their systems again this week, as the company says it aims to get dealers back online by July 4th.

“We are continuing our phased approach to the restoration process and are rapidly bringing dealers live on the Dealer Management System (DMS),” Lisa Finney, a CDK Global spokesperson, says in a statement to *The Verge*. “We anticipate all dealers connections will be live by late Wednesday, July 3 or early morning Thursday, July 4.

CDK Global has already brought “two small groups of dealers” and “one large publicly traded dealer group” back live on its DMS, according to a statement [given to CBS MoneyWatch](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdk-cyber-attack-update-some-systems-restored/).
