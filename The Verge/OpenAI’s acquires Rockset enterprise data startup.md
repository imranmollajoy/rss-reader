OpenAI has acquired Rockset, an enterprise analytics startup, to “power our retrieval infrastructure across products,” according to a [Friday blog post](https://openai.com/index/openai-acquires-rockset/).

This acquisition is OpenAI’s first where the company will integrate both a company’s technology and its team, a spokesperson [tells *Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/openai-buys-enterprise-startup-rockset-to-help-customers-sift-through-data). The two companies didn’t share the terms of the acquisition. Rockset has raised $105 million in funding to date.

“Rockset’s infrastructure empowers companies to transform their data into actionable intelligence,” OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap says in a statement. “We’re excited to bring these benefits to our customers by integrating Rockset’s foundation into OpenAI products.”

“Rockset will become part of OpenAI and power the retrieval infrastructure backing OpenAI’s product suite,” Rockset CEO Venkat Venkataramani says [in a Rockset blog post](https://rockset.com/blog/openai-acquires-rockset/). “We’ll be helping OpenAI solve the hard database problems that AI apps face at massive scale.”

Venkataramani says that current Rockset customers won’t experience “immediate change” and that the company will gradually transition them off the platform. “Some” members of Rockset’s team will move over to OpenAI, *Bloomberg* says.
