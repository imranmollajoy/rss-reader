A hacker breached the systems behind Tile device trackers and stole customer data, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers. According to [reporting from *404 Media*](https://www.404media.co/hacker-accesses-internal-tile-tool-that-provides-location-data-to-cops/), which was contacted by the hacker, the collected information came from a database that indicated it was intended for law enforcement to identify owners of specific Tile trackers. The stolen information did not include precise Tile location data.

Life360, which owns Tile, [published a statement](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Funauthorized-access-incident-2024) by CEO Chris Hulls acknowledging the hack. Hulls confirmed the data includes Tile tracker IDs and said that the hacker had attempted to extort Life360 and that the company reported it to law enforcement.

In an email to *The Verge*, Hulls wrote, “From what I gather, very little was accessed.” Hulls did not respond to a question about whether the company would contact affected customers. “We are continuing to work with law enforcement on the matter and have no other updates at this time,” Life360 representative Kristi Collura tells *The Verge* in another email.

The hacker reportedly gained access using login credentials supposedly belonging to a former Tile employee. [*404 Media* was provided screenshots by the hacker](https://www.404media.co/hacker-accesses-internal-tile-tool-that-provides-location-data-to-cops/) indicating they had access to various internal tools designed to transfer ownership of a Tile tracker, add admin accounts, and send messages to Tile users.
