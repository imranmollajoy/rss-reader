Time really does fly, doesn’t it? It seems like only yesterday we were looking at [Amazon’s fall Prime Day roundup of deals](/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech). But the company is not going to leave enthusiastic shoppers alone — [Amazon has announced](/2024/6/25/24145258/amazon-prime-day-dates-july-2024-sale) that its two-day summer sales event for Prime subscribers will take place starting at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET on Tuesday, July 16th, and run through Wednesday, July 17th,

If you’re interested in the goodies being offered but haven’t signed up for Amazon Prime, don’t worry — Amazon makes it very easy.

Besides giving access to Prime Day bargains, [Amazon has come up with a bunch of features](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=23945845011&tag=theverge02-20) to entice people to sign up for its Prime service. These include access to its streaming video service [Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/?tag=theverge02-20), which unfortunately is no longer ad-free, although you can [opt for that](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TD5EYJIUGQMY13QQdi&tag=theverge02-20); free and faster shipping on purchases (with two-day or one-day delivery for many items and even same-day delivery for some); same-day delivery on [a selection of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods groceries](https://www.amazon.com/fmc/learn-more?tag=theverge02-20); [Amazon Music Prime](https://www.amazon.com/music/prime/?tag=theverge02-20) ad-free audio streaming (not to be confused with the more extensive [Amazon Music Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited/?tag=theverge02-20), which is an additional $9.99 per month for Prime members and $10.99 per month for nonmembers); [Prime Gaming](https://gaming.amazon.com/), which includes a free Twitch channel subscription; unlimited photo storage (along with 5GB of video storage); and [Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/nonprime-pr/?tag=theverge02-20), which gives you access to a rotating library of comics, books, and magazines as well as early access to a curated selection of new books.

You can [share your Prime account](https://www.amazon.com/myh/households?tag=theverge02-20) — and most of its features — with one other adult, along with up to four teens and four children. And you get a 30-day free trial, so you can try it (and the Prime Day specials) out.

We should probably mention the obvious: you can sign up for a Prime membership, take advantage of the free 30-day trial, and then cancel it after the Prime Day sales are over. But you can only do that once, so you won’t be able to use that trick next year when Prime Day comes around.
