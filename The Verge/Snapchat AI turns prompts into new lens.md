Snapchat offered [an early look](https://newsroom.snap.com/new-ar-experiences-powered-by-gen-ai) at its upcoming on-device AI model capable of transforming a user’s surroundings with augmented reality (AR). The new model will eventually let creators turn a text prompt into a custom lens — potentially opening the door for some wild looks to try on and send to friends.

You can see how this might look in the GIF below, which shows a person’s clothing and background transforming in real-time based on the prompt “50s sci-fi film.” Users will start seeing lenses using this new model in the coming months, while creators can start making lenses with the model by the end of this year, [according to *TechCrunch*](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/18/snap-previews-its-real-time-image-model-that-can-generate-ar-experiences/)*.*

Additionally, Snapchat is rolling out a suite of new AI tools that could make it easier for creators to make custom augmented reality (AR) effects. Some of the tools now available with the latest [Lens Studio update](https://ar.snap.com/blog/genai-suite-lens-studio-5.0?lang=en-US) include [new face effects](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/platform-solutions/snap-ml/face-ml-in-ls?lang=en-US) that let creators write a prompt or upload an image to create a custom lens that completely transforms a user’s face.

The suite also includes a feature, [called Immersive ML](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/platform-solutions/snap-ml/immersive-ml-in-ls), that applies a “realistic transformation over the user’s face, body, and surroundings in real time.” Other AI tools coming to Lens Studio allow lens creators to generate 3D assets based on a text or image prompt, create face masks and textures, as well as make 3D character heads that mimic a user’s expression.

Over the past year, Snapchat has rolled out several new AI features, including a way for subscribers to [send AI-generated snaps to friends](/2023/12/12/23998614/snapchat-subscribers-ai-generated-snaps). Snapchat also launched a [ChatGPT-powered AI chatbot](/2023/4/19/23688913/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-release-open-ai) to all users last year.
