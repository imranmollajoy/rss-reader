Microsoft is [rolling out an Xbox update](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/xbox-june-update/) that lets you view game art with any Xbox Home background. That means you’ll continue to see your dynamic or regular background when you’re not scrolling through different games.

Previously, Microsoft only let you view game art with the default Xbox Home background. Now, you can keep your background *and* view game art without having to decide between the two. [Microsoft first started testing](/2024/5/1/24146171/the-xbox-ui-is-getting-better) this feature in April, and you can see how it looks in this embedded post from my colleague Tom Warren.

To enable this option, head to your Xbox’s Settings menu, and then select **General &gt; Personalization &gt; My Background**. From there, choose **Show selected game art**. You can also now update your dynamic background color without changing the color of your profile.

Microsoft is rolling out a few other updates, too, including the ability for your Xbox to remember up to 10 Wi-Fi networks, saving you from having to set up the network information and passwords all over again each time you move your console from one place to another.

It’s also rolling out a controller update that allows the Xbox Adaptive Controller to have “expanded support for more connected USB accessories,” with each port now supporting up to 12 buttons, a second stick, and a hat switch, plus more stable audio connections for headsets plugged in to an Elite Wireless 2 gamepad.

Additionally, Microsoft is making [mouse and keyboard support](/2024/3/26/24112659/xbox-cloud-gaming-mouse-and-keyboard-support-preview) in Xbox Cloud Gaming available to everyone and will now allow players to self-manage game data and cloud saves for titles played on their browser, Xbox’s website, or the Xbox app on Samsung TVs.
