Hello there!

I live in a small village in Bangladesh. Although (যদিও) this place is remote (প্রত্যন্ত/বিচ্ছিন্ন) and not so developed (উন্নত), visitors love it for its beautiful, green landscape. Its environment is as refreshing as the gentle morning breeze (মৃদুমন্দ বাতাস). The people living here are friendly. They work as hard as an ant gathering its harvest (ফসল). If you visit my village, you can enjoy the colourful cropland, the fresh food and the warm hospitality of the villagers. Especially (বিশেষ করে) you can taste the mangoes which are as sweet as honey. A river surrounds the village like a snake. There is a market in the heart of the village. Whenever you visit there, you see people are as busy as bees. You can move anywhere at any time, as it is as safe as your home. It is also one of the cleanest villages in this area. The only difficulty that you may face is a power cut. Very often, the night is as quiet as a sleeping baby here. But then again you can enjoy the beauty of the night sky. So, if you plan to spend some time in nature, my village will be a good choice.
